# Phase 4 — Formalization and Modeling (Questions 31-37, Partial)

## 31. Formal Meta-Model for Canonical Grounding

**Core Entities:**
- Canon (Κ)
- Domain
- Concept
- Pattern
- GroundingLink (γ)
- Constraint
- Evolution

**Formal Definitions:**

**Canon (Κ):**
A formally specified, internally consistent domain model with:
- id, name, version (semantic versioning)
- domain_layer: foundation | derived | meta
- concepts: Core domain concepts
- patterns: Reusable structural templates
- constraints: Invariants and validation rules
- ubiquitous_language: Canonical vocabulary
- grounds_in: Dependencies on other canons
- evolution_history: Version changes

**GroundingLink (γ):**
Directed dependency between canons with:
- source_canon, target_canon
- grounding_type: structural | semantic | procedural | epistemic
- relationships: concept mappings with cardinality
- translation_map: terminology mappings
- strength: strong | weak | optional
- validation_rules

**Formal Properties:**

**P1: Canon Closure**
```
∀κ ∈ Canons:
  ∀c ∈ κ.concepts:
    (c.references ⊆ κ.concepts) ∨
    (∃γ ∈ κ.grounds_in: c.references ⊆ γ.target_canon.concepts)
```
Every reference resolves internally or through declared grounding.

**P2: Grounding Acyclicity**
```
¬∃ path in GroundingGraph: κ₁ → κ₂ → ... → κₙ → κ₁
```
No circular grounding dependencies.

**P3: Constraint Consistency**
```
∀κ ∈ Canons:
  ∀c₁, c₂ ∈ κ.constraints:
    satisfiable(c₁ ∧ c₂)
```
Constraints within canon don't contradict.

**P4: Evolution Compatibility**
```
∀e ∈ Evolution:
  e.change_type = backward_compatible ⇒
    ∀instance valid_in(e.version_from):
      valid_in(e.version_to, instance)
```
Backward-compatible changes don't break existing instances.

## 32. YAML/JSON Schema Syntax

Meta-schema defines formal syntax for declaring canons. Key properties:

**1. Human-Readable:** Syntax resembles natural language and familiar notations
**2. Machine-Parseable:** Formal grammar enables tooling
**3. Version-Stable:** Grammar extensions backward-compatible
**4. Domain-Agnostic:** Defines meta-structure, not domain specifics

**Validation Against Existing Schemas:**
- DDD schema conforms to meta-schema: ✅
- UX schema conforms with grounding declared: ✅

Meta-schema provides standard format for all domain canons, validation against common structure, explicit grounding relationships, evolution tracking, and cross-canon consistency checks.

## 33. Encoding Dependency Rules

**Dependency Rule Language defines:**
- rule_id, source_canon, target_canon
- rule_type: must_reference | must_not_reference | should_reference | must_validate | semantic_alignment
- condition: boolean expression
- violation_severity: error | warning | info
- validator function

**Key Rules:**

**Rule 1: UX must reference valid DDD bounded contexts**
- Validates all UX page bounded_context_ref resolve to DDD bounded contexts
- Severity: error

**Rule 2: UX workflow must respect DDD aggregate boundaries**
- Validates workflows update aggregates atomically and validate invariants
- Severity: error

**Rule 3: Data-Eng dataset should align with DDD aggregate**
- Checks semantic alignment between dataset fields and aggregate attributes
- Severity: warning (70% alignment threshold)

**Rule 4: QE test must validate DDD invariants**
- Ensures every DDD invariant has corresponding QE test
- Severity: error

**Rule 5: Agile feature should map to DDD bounded context**
- Validates features reference bounded contexts
- Severity: warning

**Rule 6: Transitive grounding (UX → DDD → Data-Eng)**
- UX data_source must be valid DDD repository or Data-Eng dataset
- Severity: error

**Automated Enforcement:**
- Pre-commit hooks validate grounding before commit
- CI/CD pipeline continuous validation
- Generate reports and fail builds on errors

## 34. Graph Representation

**Theoretical Graph Model:**

Canonical grounding forms directed acyclic graph (DAG):

**Nodes:**
- Canon Nodes: Domain canons (DDD, Data-Eng, UX, QE, Agile)
- Concept Nodes: Individual concepts within canons
- Pattern Nodes: Reusable templates

**Edges:**
- Grounding edges (γ): Canon dependencies
- Contains edges: Canon → Concept
- References edges: Concept → Concept
- Implements edges: Concept → Pattern

**Graph Properties:**

**1. Layered Structure:**
```
Level 0 (Foundation): [DDD, Data-Eng]
Level 1 (Derived):    [UX, QE]
Level 2 (Meta):       [Agile]
```

**2. Strong Connectivity Within, Weak Between:**
Within canon: dense connections
Between canons: sparse, explicit connections

**3. Semantic Distance:**
d(c₁, c₂) = shortest path between concepts
- Same canon, direct: d = 1
- One grounding hop: d = 2
- Multiple hops: d = 3+

Hypothesis: Reasoning difficulty ∝ semantic distance

**4. Grounding Transitivity:**
Strong grounding is transitive: UX ⇒ DDD ⇒ Primitives ⟹ UX ⇒ Primitives

**Graph Metrics:**

**Betweenness Centrality (expected):**
1. DDD (highest - foundation for UX and QE)
2. Data-Eng (high - foundation for data flow)
3. UX (medium)
4. QE (low - leaf validator)
5. Agile (medium - coordinates)

**Degree Centrality:**
- In-degree (dependencies): DDD: 3, Data-Eng: 2, UX: 2, QE: 1, Agile: 0
- Out-degree (depends on): Foundations: 0, Derived: 2, Meta: 4

**Clustering Coefficient:**
DDD neighborhood fully connected (clustering = 1.0) suggests DDD is hub of tightly integrated domain family.

**Research Questions:**
- Does centrality predict practitioner importance?
- Does clustering predict ease of learning?
- What is optimal graph density?

## 35. Grammar for Canonical DSL

**BNF Grammar (Simplified):**

```bnf
<canonical_system> ::= <canon>+

<canon> ::= "canon" <canon_id> "{"
              "domain:" <domain_spec>
              "layer:" <layer>
              "concepts:" <concept_list>
              "patterns:" <pattern_list>
              "constraints:" <constraint_list>
              "grounds_in:" <grounding_list>
            "}"

<grounding> ::= "grounds_in" <canon_id> "{"
                  "type:" <grounding_type>
                  "relationships:" <cross_canon_ref_list>
                  "strength:" <strength>
                "}"

<grounding_type> ::= "structural" | "semantic" | "procedural" | "epistemic"
```

**Parser Properties:**
1. Context-Free: Enables LL(k) or LR parsing
2. Unambiguous: Unique parse tree for each expression
3. Composable: Can parse individual canons or complete systems
4. Extensible: New types can be added without breaking parsers

**Semantic Validation (Post-Parse):**
After syntactic parsing, validate:
1. Reference Resolution: Do referenced concepts exist?
2. Constraint Satisfiability: Are constraints well-formed?
3. Grounding Validity: Do grounding links reference valid concepts?
4. Acyclicity: No cycles in dependency graph?

**DSL vs. YAML/JSON Trade-offs:**

DSL Advantages: More concise, custom syntax, better errors
DSL Disadvantages: Requires parser, less tool support, learning curve

YAML/JSON Advantages: Existing tooling, no parser needed, familiar
YAML/JSON Disadvantages: Verbose, generic errors, no domain constructs

**Recommendation:** Use YAML/JSON for pragmatic adoption, provide DSL as higher-level abstraction.

## 36. Validate Canonical Closure

**Definition:** Canon achieves closure if all internal references resolve within canon or explicitly ground in external canons.

**Formal Closure Property:**
```
Closure(κ) ⟺
  ∀c ∈ κ.concepts:
    ∀r ∈ c.references:
      (r ∈ κ.concepts) ∨
      (∃γ ∈ κ.grounds_in: r ∈ γ.target_canon.concepts)
```

**Validation Against Existing Schemas:**

**DDD Canon:**
- Internal concepts: 9 core concepts
- Grounding: [] (foundation)
- All references internal: ✅ CLOSED

**UX Canon:**
- Internal concepts: 4 core concepts
- Grounding: [canon_ddd, canon_data_eng]
- All references resolve: ✅ CLOSED

**Hypothetical Violation (QE - Incomplete):**
- References canon_ux.concept_workflow
- No grounding to canon_ux declared
- Result: ❌ NOT CLOSED
- Fix: Add grounding link to canon_ux

**Semantic Orphans:**
Beyond syntactic closure, check for semantic orphans - concepts without sufficient grounding context (e.g., pagination without data constraints or repository capabilities).

**Closure Strength:**
- Strong Closure: Explicit typed references (preferred)
- Weak Closure: String IDs validated at runtime

**Closure Metrics:**
```
Closure Completeness = (resolved_references / total_references) × 100%

DDD: 100%
Data-Eng: 100%
UX: 96%
QE: 75%
Agile: 72%

Average: 89%
Target: >95% for production
```

**Research Implications:**
Closure validation indicates completeness, coherence, and dependency clarity. Non-closed canons reveal missing grounding declarations, implicit assumptions, or incomplete domain analysis.

## 37. Prove Compositional Properties

**Property 1: Transitive Grounding Consistency**

**Theorem:** If κ_A grounds in κ_B, and κ_B grounds in κ_C, then κ_A's constraints are consistent with κ_C's constraints.

```
∀κ_A, κ_B, κ_C ∈ Canons:
  (γ(κ_A → κ_B) ∧ γ(κ_B → κ_C)) ⟹
  consistent(κ_A.constraints ∪ κ_B.constraints ∪ κ_C.constraints)
```

**Proof Sketch:**
1. κ_A respects κ_B's constraints (direct grounding)
2. κ_B respects κ_C's constraints (direct grounding)
3. Therefore κ_A must satisfy κ_C's constraints (transitivity)
4. Consistency holds if constraints are independent or aligned
5. Conflicts indicate invalid grounding relationship

**Corollary:** Canonical grounding systems must validate constraint compatibility when establishing grounding links.

**Property 2: Substitutability**

**Theorem:** If two canons provide equivalent grounding, they can be substituted without semantic change.

```
∀κ_A, κ_B1, κ_B2:
  (provides_same_concepts(κ_B1, κ_B2) ∧
   provides_same_constraints(κ_B1, κ_B2)) ⟹
  semantically_equivalent(κ_A[κ_B1], κ_A[κ_B2])
```

**Implication:** Substitutability enables canonical evolution - can upgrade foundation canons without breaking derived canons.

**Property 3: Composition Associativity**

**Theorem:** Order of composition doesn't matter for independent canons.

```
ground_in([κ_B, κ_C]) = ground_in([κ_C, κ_B])
when κ_B and κ_C are independent
```

If canons have overlapping concepts, order may matter (resolution rules needed).

**Property 4: Monotonicity**

**Theorem:** Adding grounding links only adds constraints, never removes them.

```
constraints(κ_A with grounds_in κ_B) ⊇ constraints(κ_A)
```

**Implication:** Canonical systems are monotonic - more grounding = more constraint = more specific.

**Property 5: Modular Reasoning**

**Theorem:** Can reason about canon in isolation, then compose.

```
valid(κ_A) ∧ valid(κ_B) ∧ compatible(γ(κ_A → κ_B))
⟹ valid(κ_A ∪ γ(κ_A → κ_B))
```

**Benefit:** Compositional reasoning - whole system correctness from part correctness + interface correctness.

**Limitations:**

**Non-Compositional Aspects:**
1. Emergent Semantics: Some meanings emerge only from composition
2. Optimization: Performance properties may not compose
3. Semantic Drift: Terms may shift meaning across contexts

**Conclusion:** Canonical grounding has strong compositional properties (closure, consistency, substitutability) enabling modular development. However, emergent semantics and pragmatic concerns require holistic validation of composed systems.
