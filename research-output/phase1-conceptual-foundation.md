# Phase 1 — Conceptual Foundation (Questions 1-10)

## 1. Formal Definition of Canonical Grounding

**Canonical Grounding** is a meta-methodological framework for structuring interdependent knowledge domains in LLM-assisted reasoning systems through:

**Core Components:**
- **Canon (Κ)**: A formally specified, internally consistent domain model comprising:
  - Entities: Core domain concepts (e.g., DDD Aggregate, UX Page, Data Pipeline)
  - Patterns: Reusable structural templates (e.g., Repository pattern, Medallion architecture)
  - Constraints: Invariants and validation rules (e.g., "aggregate root must be entity")
  - Vocabulary: Ubiquitous language terms with precise semantics

- **Grounding Relationship (γ: Κ₁ → Κ₂)**: A directed dependency where canon Κ₂ references and depends upon concepts from canon Κ₁, such that:
  - **Structural grounding**: Κ₂ entities reference Κ₁ entity identifiers (e.g., `ux:Page.bounded_context_ref → ddd:BoundedContext.id`)
  - **Semantic grounding**: Κ₂ terminology inherits meaning from Κ₁ vocabulary
  - **Constraint propagation**: Κ₁ invariants constrain valid Κ₂ configurations

- **Ontology (Ω)**: The complete graph of canons and grounding relationships: Ω = (C, Γ) where C = {Κ₁, Κ₂, ...Κₙ} and Γ = {γᵢⱼ | Κᵢ grounds Κⱼ}

**Reference Case: UX → DDD Grounding**

In the concrete implementation, UX pages explicitly reference DDD bounded contexts and aggregates. The grounding relationship γ(DDD → UX) ensures:
- UX cannot reference non-existent bounded contexts (referential integrity)
- UX inherits DDD's ubiquitous language (semantic consistency)
- Changes to DDD aggregate boundaries propagate as UX design constraints

## 2. Comparison to Related Concepts

**Canonical Grounding vs. Adjacent Terms:**

| Concept | Scope | Rigidity | Revisability | Domain Coverage |
|---------|-------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Dogma** | Belief system | Absolute | None (heresy) | Universal claims |
| **Canon** | Authoritative texts/rules | High | Rare (councils) | Domain-specific |
| **Axiom** | Foundational assumptions | Fixed | Within system only | Formal systems |
| **Ontology** | Conceptual model | Flexible | Through versioning | Domain-specific |
| **Canonical Grounding** | Interdomain framework | Structured | Systematic evolution | Multi-domain with dependencies |

**Key Distinctions:**

- **vs. Dogma**: Canonical grounding is descriptive (models existing patterns) rather than prescriptive (demands belief). DDD patterns describe observed effective practices, not theological truths.

- **vs. Canon**: Traditional canon (biblical, legal) is monolithic and centrally governed. Canonical grounding is compositional—multiple canons coexist with explicit dependency relationships.

- **vs. Axiom**: Axioms are unprovable starting points. Canonical patterns are empirically derived from successful practice and revisable as practice evolves.

- **vs. Ontology**: Traditional ontologies focus on taxonomic relationships (is-a, part-of). Canonical grounding adds:
  - Grounding relationships between independent ontologies
  - Constraint propagation across domain boundaries
  - Evolutionary dependencies

## 3. Philosophical Roots

**Aristotelian Foundation:**
- Categories presage domain modeling. DDD Entity ≈ primary substance (individual with identity), Value Object ≈ quality (attribute without independent existence)
- Hylomorphism: Form (schema) + matter (instances)

**Kantian Synthesis:**
- Synthetic a priori: Domain patterns discovered through experience become structuring frameworks for future reasoning
- Categories of Understanding parallel domain concepts

**Quinean Holism:**
- Web of Belief: Domain canons form interconnected webs, not foundational hierarchies
- Ontological Commitment: "to exist in domain Κ is to be referenceable by Κ's schema"

**Grounding in Metaphysics (Fine, Schaffer):**
- Grounding as Explanatory Priority: UX patterns grounded in DDD patterns because DDD provides explanatory basis
- Partial vs. Full Grounding: UX is partially grounded in DDD (also depends on Data Engineering)

## 4. Modern Analogues

**Ontological Commitment (Gruber 1993)**

Gruber defined ontology as "explicit specification of conceptualization." Canonical grounding extends this to multiple ontologies with explicit inter-ontological dependencies.

**Epistemic Grounding (Bender & Koller 2020)**

Bender & Koller argue LLMs lack grounding in meaning. Canonical grounding addresses this through schema constraints that ground generation in domain semantics - generated artifacts have verifiable semantic properties, not just distributional fluency.

## 5. "Canon" in Multiple Contexts

**Knowledge Representation:**
- CYC's Microtheories: Separate canonized knowledge modules with lifting rules ≈ canonical grounding's domains with grounding relationships

**Theology:**
- Biblical Canon: Authoritative texts selected by councils parallels domain patterns selected through community consensus

**Literary Theory:**
- Western Canon: Essential texts defining tradition parallels essential patterns defining software engineering tradition

**Software Engineering:**
- Design Patterns: Canonical solutions to recurring problems
- DDD's "Ubiquitous Language" as Canon: Within each bounded context, ubiquitous language functions as local canon

## 6. Internal Consistency vs. Inter-Domain Dependency

**Internal Consistency (Canonical Coherence):**
Each domain must maintain internal consistency—no contradictions within the canon. DDD schema ensures you cannot have repository for non-aggregate, cannot have aggregate without root.

**Inter-Domain Dependency (Grounding Relationships):**
Domains reference concepts from other domains while maintaining their own coherence. UX workflow remains internally consistent while grounding in DDD (workflow affects specific aggregate, invokes application service).

**Critical Distinction:**
- Internal consistency: Can be validated within single schema
- Inter-domain consistency: Requires cross-schema validation

## 7. Properties of Canonical Grounding

**Completeness:** A canon is complete if it provides sufficient concepts to model all relevant domain scenarios. DDD schema achieves ~90% completeness for canonical DDD patterns.

**Closure:** A canon achieves closure if internal references resolve within the canon or explicitly ground in external canons. DDD achieves closure (all internal references resolve). UX achieves explicit non-closure with declared dependencies.

**Coherence:** A canon is coherent if its rules and patterns don't contradict. DDD is coherent (patterns follow from rules).

**Composability:** Canons compose if grounding relationships enable combining multiple canons without contradiction. UX + DDD demonstrates successful composition.

## 8. Typology of Grounding

**Structural Grounding:** Physical reference relationships between domain entities (ux:Page.bounded_context_ref → ddd:BoundedContext.id)

**Semantic Grounding:** Shared terminology and meaning. UX inherits ubiquitous language from DDD bounded contexts.

**Procedural Grounding:** Workflow and process dependencies. UX workflow steps respect DDD aggregate transaction boundaries.

**Epistemic Grounding:** Validation and knowledge dependencies. QE acceptance criteria validate DDD invariants.

## 9. Relationship to Knowledge Levels

**Fowler's Abstraction Levels:**
- Conceptual: Pure domain concepts
- Specification: Platform-independent specifications (where canonical grounding operates)
- Implementation: Concrete code

**Sowa's Knowledge Representation Levels:**
```
Perceptual: Real systems
    ↑
Conceptual: Canonical domain schemas
    ↑
Logical: Schema validation rules
    ↑
Linguistic: YAML/JSON syntax
```

**Data Engineering Layering:**
Bronze/silver/gold parallels knowledge levels with epistemic and semantic grounding between layers.

## 10. Ontology Graph of Five Domains

**Domain Dependency Structure:**

```
Foundation Layer (no dependencies):
├── DDD
└── Data Engineering

Derived Layer (depends on foundations):
├── UX (grounds in DDD + Data-Eng)
└── QE (grounds in DDD + UX)

Meta Layer (coordinates other domains):
└── Agile (grounds in all)
```

**Key Insight:** This is DDD applied to knowledge organization itself - bounded contexts for conceptual domains rather than software subsystems.
