# üî¨ Research Prompt (Revised)
**Title:** Examining Canonical Grounding as a Framework for Layered Ontological Reasoning in LLM Systems

**Goal:**
To evaluate the conceptual validity, empirical grounding, and research lineage of *Canonical Grounding* as a meta-methodology for structuring interdependent domains (DDD, Data Engineering, UX, QE, Agile) in LLM-assisted reasoning systems.

**Context:**
This research is grounded in a concrete implementation comprising five domain canons with formal YAML/JSON schemas and practical examples. The foundational domains are DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and Data Engineering, which serve as grounding layers for UX (grounded in DDD), QE (grounded in DDD and UX), and Agile (currently standalone but should reference DDD, Data Engineering, QE, and UX). Each domain contains:
- A formal schema definition (model-schema.yaml) describing canonical patterns and relationships
- Domain guide documents explaining concepts and terminology
- Concrete examples mapping real-world solutions to the formal schema

## üß≠ Phase 1 ‚Äî Conceptual Foundation (1‚Äì10)
1. Define "Canonical Grounding" formally: ontology, canon, grounding relationships, using the DDD-to-UX dependency as a reference case where UX schema references DDD bounded contexts and aggregates.
2. Compare its semantics to "dogma," "canon," "axiom," and "ontology" in philosophical and AI contexts.
3. Map philosophical roots (Aristotle ‚Üí Kant ‚Üí Quine ‚Üí grounding in metaphysics).
4. Identify modern analogues: *ontological commitment* (Gruber 1993), *epistemic grounding* (Bender & Koller 2020).
5. Review uses of "canon" in knowledge representation, theology, literary theory, and software engineering, considering how DDD's "Ubiquitous Language" and "Bounded Context" function as canonical constraints.
6. Distinguish between *internal consistency* (canon) and *inter-domain dependency* (grounding), examining how Data Engineering's pipeline patterns must remain internally consistent while also grounding UX data display patterns.
7. Define properties: completeness, closure, coherence, composability‚Äîvalidate these against the existing domain schemas (e.g., does the DDD schema achieve closure within bounded contexts?).
8. Propose typology of grounding: structural (UX references DDD entity IDs), semantic (shared ubiquitous language), procedural (Agile workflows reference DDD aggregates), epistemic (QE validation depends on DDD invariants).
9. Clarify relationship to *knowledge levels* (Fowler, Sowa), comparing to the layering in data engineering (bronze/silver/gold) and DDD (strategic/tactical patterns).
10. Establish working definitions and ontology graph of five target domains, incorporating actual dependency structure: DDD ‚Üê {Data-Eng} as foundations; UX ‚Üê {DDD, Data-Eng}; QE ‚Üê {DDD, UX}; Agile ‚Üê {DDD, Data-Eng, QE, UX}.

## üß© Phase 2 ‚Äî Comparative Theoretical Analysis (11‚Äì20)
11. Compare Canonical Grounding with *Domain-Driven Design's Bounded Contexts*, analyzing whether each domain schema (DDD, Data-Eng, UX, QE, Agile) effectively constitutes a bounded context with explicit context mapping relationships.
12. Analyze *Data Engineering* as a grounding layer: schema, data lineage, semantic contracts‚Äîexamine how its contract and lineage patterns provide foundational vocabulary for UX data displays and QE data quality checks.
13. Examine *UX* as derived canon: grounded in DDD + Data semantics‚Äîanalyze how UX schema's references to bounded_context_ref and aggregate_ref create formal grounding relationships.
14. Evaluate *Quality Engineering* canon: validation of prior domain assumptions‚Äîstudy how QE acceptance criteria validate DDD invariants and UX workflows.
15. Study *Agile methodology* as meta-canon managing temporal evolution of others‚Äîexamine how Feature/Epic/Story hierarchy could reference DDD aggregates and Data Engineering pipelines.
16. Compare with *Kuhn's paradigm theory* and *Lakatos's research programmes*, considering whether each domain schema constitutes a paradigm with core commitments.
17. Contrast with *ontological layering* in model-driven architecture (MDA), comparing MDA's CIM/PIM/PSM levels to the strategic/tactical/implementation layering evident in the domain schemas.
18. Relate to *knowledge representation levels* (Sowa, OWL, RDF), examining whether the YAML/JSON schema definitions could be translated to RDF/OWL for formal reasoning.
19. Compare to *conceptual schema approach* in information systems (Wand & Weber), analyzing whether domain schemas meet criteria for conceptual completeness.
20. Position Canonical Grounding relative to *epistemic pluralism* and *scientific realism*‚Äîdoes allowing multiple domain canons constitute pluralism, and do the schemas make realist or constructivist ontological commitments?

---

## üßÆ Phase 3 ‚Äî Empirical and Computational Validation (21‚Äì30)
21. Review LLM "grounding" literature (schema-based, RAG, ontology-aware models), specifically examining how schema-grounded prompting differs from free-form generation.
22. Identify experiments where grounding reduces hallucinations or improves accuracy, particularly in domain-specific reasoning (software architecture, data modeling, UX design).
23. Analyze results from *Schema-Grounded LLMs* (Xu et al., 2024) and related work on constrained generation.
24. Compare performance of ungrounded vs. schema-grounded reasoning tasks using actual domain schemas (e.g., "design a DDD aggregate" with vs. without schema constraints).
25. Design pilot test: prompt LLM to reason within each canon (DDD, UX, QE, Data-Eng, Agile) using schema definitions, measuring:
   - Adherence to canonical patterns (e.g., proper aggregate boundaries in DDD)
   - Correct use of inter-domain references (e.g., UX referring to valid DDD bounded contexts)
   - Consistency with domain best practices encoded in schemas
26. Measure reduction in reasoning entropy / token perplexity when schema context is provided vs. general prompting.
27. Evaluate cross-domain inference consistency: can LLM correctly propagate constraints from DDD to UX (e.g., understanding that UX workflow must respect DDD aggregate boundaries)?
28. Quantify benefits in solution synthesis time and coherence when using canonical schemas vs. unstructured domain knowledge.
29. Examine alignment with SWE-Bench, GPQA, and reasoning benchmarks‚Äîdo canonical schemas improve performance on domain-specific software engineering tasks?
30. Document qualitative reasoning patterns (traceability, hierarchical referencing): does schema grounding enable clearer explanation of why certain design decisions follow from domain constraints?

## üß± Phase 4 ‚Äî Formalization and Modeling (31‚Äì40)
31. Develop formal meta-model for Canonical Grounding (entities: Canon, Domain, GroundingLink) that abstracts over the concrete domain schemas.
32. Define YAML / JSON Schema syntax for declaring canons, validating against existing schemas (ddd/model-schema.yaml, data-eng/model.schema.yaml, ux/model-schema.yaml, agile/model.schema.yaml).
33. Encode dependency rules (UX grounded in DDD + Data Engineering, QE grounded in DDD + UX, etc.) as formal constraints that can be validated.
34. Represent model in graph form (RDF/OWL or Graphviz), showing:
   - Nodes: canonical entities (e.g., ddd:Aggregate, ux:Page, data-eng:Pipeline)
   - Edges: grounding relationships (e.g., ux:Page.aggregate_ref ‚Üí ddd:Aggregate)
35. Create grammar (BNF) for expressing Canonical DSL, enabling formal parsing and validation of domain schemas.
36. Validate canonical closure (no semantic orphan nodes): ensure every reference in UX schema (e.g., bounded_context_ref) resolves to a defined DDD entity.
37. Prove compositional properties (e.g. transitive grounding consistency): if UX grounds in DDD, and QE grounds in UX, does QE transitively depend on DDD constraints?
38. Map to ArchiMate or UML metamodel for interoperability, enabling export of canonical models to standard enterprise architecture tools.
39. Formalize reasoning protocol: LLM reads schema ‚Üí constrains generation ‚Üí validates output against canonical rules.
40. Document mapping procedure from Canon ‚Üí Prompt ‚Üí Generated Artifact, using concrete examples:
   - Input: DDD schema + "design order management"
   - Prompt: Schema-grounded instructions with bounded context patterns
   - Output: Valid DDD model conforming to schema

## üß† Phase 5 ‚Äî Synthesis and Evaluation (41‚Äì50)
41. Compare Canonical Grounding to *Dogma*, *Paradigm*, *Framework*, *Architecture*‚Äîwhich metaphor best captures the role of formal domain schemas in constraining and enabling reasoning?
42. Assess whether Canonical Grounding meets scientific criteria (testability, coherence, usefulness):
   - Testability: Can schema conformance be automatically validated?
   - Coherence: Do inter-domain references resolve consistently?
   - Usefulness: Does it improve LLM-assisted software/system design?
43. Identify epistemic risks (rigidity, over-constraint): could canonical schemas stifle innovation or force artificial consistency where domain flexibility is needed?
44. Evaluate adaptability to new domains (e.g. Compliance, Legal, Finance): what would a canonical schema for Security or DevOps look like, and how would it ground in existing domains?
45. Survey practitioners on intuitiveness and learnability of Canonical DSL: can domain experts author schemas? Can developers understand and use them?
46. Evaluate cognitive load for domain experts reasoning within canons: does schema structure help or hinder thinking about design problems?
47. Test LLM fine-tuning or RAG integration on Canonical datasets: does training on schema-conformant examples improve generation quality?
48. Document findings against design-science evaluation frameworks (Hevner): does Canonical Grounding meet criteria for useful research artifacts in information systems?
49. Synthesize research lineage: from ontology engineering ‚Üí schema grounding ‚Üí LLM reasoning ‚Üí Canonical Grounding as synthesis of these traditions.
50. Draft final meta-framework: **Canonical Grounding for Knowledge-Layered Reasoning Systems**, including:
   - Formal specification of what constitutes a canonical domain
   - Rules for establishing grounding relationships between domains
   - Validation procedures for canonical consistency
   - Integration protocols for LLM-based reasoning systems
   - Limitations (where canonical grounding breaks down)
   - Next-phase research plan (extending to additional domains, empirical studies with practitioners)
