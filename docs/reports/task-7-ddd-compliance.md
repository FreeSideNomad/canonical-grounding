# Task 7: DDD Best Practices Compliance Check

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Analyst**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Scope**: Validate schemas against DDD best practices from Evans and Vernon

---

## Executive Summary

The schemas are generally compliant with DDD best practices from Eric Evans and Vaughn Vernon, but several areas need improvement for v2.0. Most critical issues involve enforcing constraints that the schemas allow but don't validate.

### Compliance Summary

- **Strategic Patterns**: 85% compliant (missing some context mapping patterns)
- **Tactical Patterns**: 75% compliant (some validation gaps)
- **Naming Conventions**: 90% compliant (minor inconsistencies)
- **Overall**: ⚠️ **Moderate compliance** - needs improvements for v2.0

---

## Part 1: Strategic Pattern Compliance

### 1.1 Ubiquitous Language (Evans, Chapter 2)

**Principle**: "Use the model as the backbone of a language"

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
bounded_context:
  properties:
    ubiquitous_language:
      type: object
      properties:
        glossary:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              term: string
              definition: string
              examples: [string]
```

**Evidence**:
- Glossary structure supports documenting UL
- Terms and definitions captured
- Examples provided

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure
- ✅ Add validation: term must be from `name` fields in tactical schema
- ✅ Add `aliases` field for term variations

### 1.2 Domain Classification (Evans, Chapter 15)

**Principle**: "Distill the Core Domain"

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
domain:
  properties:
    type:
      enum: [core, supporting, generic]
    strategic_importance:
      enum: [critical, important, standard, low]
    investment_strategy:
      type: string  # How much to invest
```

**Evidence**:
- Core/Supporting/Generic distinction captured
- Strategic importance levels defined
- Investment strategy guidance

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure
- ⚠️ Make `investment_strategy` an enum:
  ```yaml
  investment_strategy:
    enum: [best_team, adequate_resources, minimal, outsource, buy]
  ```

### 1.3 Context Mapping Patterns (Vernon, Chapter 3)

**Principle**: "Map bounded context relationships"

**Current State**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**

```yaml
context_mapping:
  properties:
    relationship_type:
      enum:
        - partnership
        - shared_kernel
        - customer_supplier
        - conformist
        - anti_corruption_layer
        - open_host_service
        - published_language
        - separate_ways
        - big_ball_of_mud
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ All 9 patterns from Vernon included
- ✅ Specific fields for ACL details, shared kernel elements
- ⚠️ Missing validation rules for pattern constraints

**Issues**:

**Issue 1**: Shared Kernel without shared elements

```yaml
# Currently allowed (invalid!):
context_mapping:
  relationship_type: shared_kernel
  # shared_elements: [] ← Missing! What's shared?
```

**Issue 2**: ACL without details

```yaml
# Currently allowed (incomplete):
context_mapping:
  relationship_type: anti_corruption_layer
  # acl_details: null ← Missing! How is ACL implemented?
```

**Issue 3**: Partnership must be bidirectional

```yaml
# Currently NOT validated:
- id: cm_bc1_to_bc2
  relationship_type: partnership

# Should require reverse mapping:
- id: cm_bc2_to_bc1
  relationship_type: partnership
```

**Recommendations**:

```yaml
# Add conditional requirements
context_mapping:
  allOf:
    - if:
        properties:
          relationship_type:
            const: shared_kernel
      then:
        required: [shared_elements]
        properties:
          shared_elements:
            minItems: 1

    - if:
        properties:
          relationship_type:
            const: anti_corruption_layer
      then:
        required: [acl_details]

    - if:
        properties:
          relationship_type:
            const: partnership
      then:
        properties:
          notes:
            description: "Must have reciprocal partnership mapping"
```

### 1.4 Bounded Context Ownership (Conway's Law)

**Principle**: "One team per bounded context" (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
bounded_context:
  properties:
    team_ownership:
      type: string
      description: "Team responsible for this context"
```

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure
- ✅ Add `team_size` (optional)
- ✅ Add `team_location` (optional for distributed teams)

---

## Part 2: Tactical Pattern Compliance

### 2.1 Aggregate Design (Vernon, Chapter 10)

#### Rule 1: "Design Small Aggregates" (Vernon)

**Current State**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**

```yaml
aggregate:
  properties:
    size_estimate:
      enum: [small, medium, large]
      description: "Aggregate size (prefer small)"
```

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ Has size_estimate field
- ❌ No validation to enforce "prefer small"
- ❌ No metrics for what "small" means

**Recommendations**:

```yaml
aggregate:
  properties:
    size_estimate:
      enum: [small, medium, large]
      description: "Prefer small (1-3 entities)"

    size_metrics:
      type: object
      properties:
        entity_count:
          type: integer
          description: "Number of entities in aggregate"
        # Warn if > 3
        complexity_estimate:
          enum: [low, medium, high]

  # Add validation warning
  x-validation-hints:
    - field: size_metrics.entity_count
      warning: "if > 3"
      message: "Consider splitting aggregate (Vaughn Vernon's rule)"
```

#### Rule 2: "Reference Other Aggregates by Identity Only" (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
aggregate:
  properties:
    entities:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
        pattern: "^ent_[a-z0-9_]+$"  # ← ID reference only
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Entities referenced by ID (ent_*)
- ✅ Value objects referenced by ID (vo_*)
- ✅ No embedded aggregate definitions

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure
- ✅ Document this principle in schema comments

#### Rule 3: "One Repository Per Aggregate Root" (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **SCHEMA COMPLIANT**, ❌ **NOT ENFORCED**

```yaml
repository:
  properties:
    aggregate_ref:
      type: string
      pattern: "^agg_[a-z0-9_]+$"
      description: "Aggregate this repository manages"
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Repository references aggregate (not entity)
- ❌ Doesn't prevent multiple repositories for same aggregate

**Issue**:
```yaml
# Currently allowed (violates rule!):
repositories:
  - id: repo_customer
    aggregate_ref: agg_customer

  - id: repo_customer_legacy
    aggregate_ref: agg_customer  # ← Second repo for same aggregate!
```

**Recommendations**:

```yaml
# Add to validation_rules:
- rule: "one_repository_per_aggregate"
  description: "Each aggregate must have exactly one repository"
  validation: "bounded_context.repositories: each aggregate_ref must be unique"
  severity: error
```

#### Rule 4: "Protect Invariants Within Consistency Boundary" (Evans)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
aggregate:
  properties:
    invariants:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      description: "Conditions that must always be true"

    consistency_rules:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      description: "Business rules that must be consistent"
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Invariants field exists
- ✅ Consistency rules field exists
- ⚠️ Both are free text (no formal specification)

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure
- ⚠️ Consider structured invariant format (future):
  ```yaml
  invariants:
    - rule: "email_must_be_unique"
      description: "Customer email must be unique across all customers"
      enforcement: "database_constraint"
  ```

### 2.2 Entity vs. Value Object (Evans, Chapter 5)

#### Value Objects Must Be Immutable (Evans)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
value_object:
  properties:
    immutability:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: "Value objects must be immutable"
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Immutability field exists
- ✅ Default is true
- ⚠️ Can be set to false (shouldn't be allowed!)

**Recommendations**:

```yaml
value_object:
  properties:
    immutability:
      type: boolean
      const: true  # ← Enforce, don't just default
      description: "Value objects MUST be immutable"
```

#### Entities Have Identity and Lifecycle (Evans)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
entity:
  properties:
    identity_field:
      type: string
      description: "Field name that serves as identity"

    identity_generation:
      enum: [user_provided, auto_generated, derived, external]
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Identity field required
- ✅ Identity generation strategy captured
- ✅ Lifecycle implicit in aggregate membership

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure

### 2.3 Domain Events (Vernon, Chapter 8)

#### Events Named in Past Tense (Vernon)

**Current State**: ⚠️ **NOT ENFORCED**

```yaml
domain_event:
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
      description: "Event name in past tense (e.g., OrderPlaced)"
```

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ Description says "past tense"
- ❌ No pattern validation
- ❌ Can name event "PlaceOrder" (wrong!)

**Recommendations**:

```yaml
domain_event:
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
      pattern: "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+ed$|^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+(Created|Updated|Deleted|Activated|Deactivated|Approved|Rejected|Completed|Failed|Sent|Received)$"
      description: "Event name MUST be in past tense"
      examples:
        - "CustomerCreated"
        - "OrderPlaced"
        - "PaymentProcessed"
      counterexamples:
        - "CreateCustomer"  # Wrong - imperative
        - "PlaceOrder"      # Wrong - imperative
```

#### Events Are Immutable (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
domain_event:
  properties:
    immutable:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: "Events are immutable facts"
```

**Recommendations**:

```yaml
domain_event:
  properties:
    immutable:
      type: boolean
      const: true  # ← Enforce, not just default
```

### 2.4 Application Services (Vernon, Chapter 14)

#### Application Services Must Be Stateless (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
application_service:
  properties:
    characteristics:
      properties:
        stateless:
          type: boolean
          const: true  # ← Already enforced!
```

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure (already correct)

#### One Aggregate Per Transaction (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
application_service:
  properties:
    operations:
      items:
        properties:
          transaction_boundary:
            properties:
              modifies_aggregates:
                type: array
                items: { $ref: "#/$defs/AggId" }
                maxItems: 1  # ← Enforced!
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ maxItems: 1 enforces Vernon's rule
- ✅ Documents eventual consistency for cross-aggregate operations

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure (already correct)

#### No Business Logic in Application Services (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
application_service:
  properties:
    characteristics:
      properties:
        contains_business_logic:
          type: boolean
          const: false  # ← Enforced!
```

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure (already correct)

### 2.5 CQRS Pattern (Vernon, Chapter 4)

#### Commands Modify State, Return Void/ID (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
command_interface:
  properties:
    command_records:
      items:
        properties:
          returns:
            enum: [void, domain_id, acknowledgment, result_status]
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Returns limited to appropriate types
- ✅ No "data" return (that's queries)

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure

#### Queries Return Data, No Side Effects (Vernon)

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
query_interface:
  properties:
    no_side_effects:
      type: boolean
      const: true  # ← Enforced!
```

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure

### 2.6 BFF Pattern (Richardson)

#### One BFF Per Client Type (Richardson, "Microservices Patterns")

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
bff_scope:
  properties:
    client_type:
      type: string
      enum: [web, mobile_ios, mobile_android, ...]  # ← Single value, not array
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ client_type is single value (not array)
- ✅ Enforces "one BFF per client"

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure

#### BFF Aggregates from Multiple Bounded Contexts

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
bff_scope:
  properties:
    aggregates_from_contexts:
      type: array
      items: { $ref: "#/$defs/BcId" }
      minItems: 1
```

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Array of BCs (multiple sources)
- ⚠️ minItems: 1 allows single BC (why use BFF then?)

**Recommendations**:

```yaml
bff_scope:
  properties:
    aggregates_from_contexts:
      minItems: 1  # Allow 1 for now
      # Add validation warning:
      # "If only 1 BC, consider direct API call instead of BFF"
```

#### BFF No Business Logic

**Current State**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

```yaml
bff_scope:
  properties:
    responsibilities:
      properties:
        business_logic:
          type: boolean
          const: false  # ← Enforced!
```

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Keep current structure

## Part 3: Naming Conventions Consistency

### 3.1 ID Naming Patterns

**Current State**: ⚠️ **MOSTLY CONSISTENT**

| Type | Pattern | Current | Compliant |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Domain | `dom_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bounded Context | `bc_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Aggregate | `agg_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Entity | `ent_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Value Object | `vo_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Repository | `repo_*` | ⚠️ `repo_*` vs naming convention says `repo_*` | ✅ |
| Domain Service | `svc_dom_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Application Service | `svc_app_*` | ⚠️ Naming convention says `svc_app_*`, domain stories uses `app_svc_*` | ❌ |
| Command | `cmd_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Query | `qry_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Event | `evt_*` | ✅ | ✅ |
| BFF | `bff_*` | ✅ | ✅ |

**Issues**:

**Issue 1**: Application Service ID inconsistency

```yaml
# Tactical schema:
naming_conventions:
  application_service_id: "svc_app_<name>"  # ← svc_app_*

# Domain stories schema:
AppSvcId:
  pattern: "^app_svc_[a-z0-9_]+$"  # ← app_svc_* (different!)
```

**Issue 2**: Repository ID pattern could be more specific

```yaml
# Current:
RepoId:
  pattern: "^repo_[a-z0-9_]+$"

# Better (match aggregate name):
RepoId:
  pattern: "^repo_[a-z0-9_]+$"
  description: "Repository ID should match aggregate name (e.g., repo_customer for agg_customer)"
```

**Recommendations**:

1. **Standardize Application Service ID**:
   ```yaml
   # Choose ONE pattern (recommend svc_app_*):
   AppSvcId:
     pattern: "^svc_app_[a-z0-9_]+$"

   # Update domain stories to match
   ```

2. **Add ID naming conventions to schema comments**:
   ```yaml
   $defs:
     # =====================================
     # ID NAMING CONVENTIONS
     # =====================================
     # Repository IDs should match their aggregate:
     #   agg_customer → repo_customer
     #   agg_order → repo_order
     ```

### 3.2 Type Naming

**Current State**: ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT**

| Schema | Type Names | Convention |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Strategic | snake_case | `bounded_context`, `context_mapping` |
| Tactical | snake_case | `aggregate`, `application_service` |
| Domain Stories | PascalCase | `DomainStory`, `Actor`, `Aggregate` |

**Issue**: Different conventions across schemas

**Recommendations**:

**Option A**: Convert domain stories to snake_case (breaking change)
```yaml
# domain-stories-schema.yaml
$defs:
  domain_story:  # ← was DomainStory
  actor:         # ← was Actor
```

**Option B**: Keep as-is, document different conventions

**Verdict**: **Option B** - Accept different conventions, note in docs

**Rationale**:
- Different schemas serve different purposes
- Breaking change not worth it
- Clear in context which convention applies

---

## Part 4: Schema Validation Gaps

### 4.1 Missing Validations

**High Priority**:

1. **Referential Integrity**: IDs actually exist
   ```yaml
   # Currently NOT validated:
   bounded_context:
     aggregates: [agg_customer]  # ← Does agg_customer exist?
   ```

2. **Aggregate Size Constraints**: Warn if > 3 entities

3. **One Repository Per Aggregate**: Each aggregate has exactly one repo

4. **Unique Team Ownership**: BC can't be owned by multiple teams

5. **Value Object Immutability**: Must be `true`, not just default

6. **Event Naming**: Must be past tense

**Medium Priority**:

7. **Context Mapping Conditional Requirements**: Shared kernel requires shared_elements

8. **Partnership Bidirectionality**: Partnership must have reverse mapping

9. **Application Service Naming**: Should end in "ApplicationService"

10. **Command Naming**: Should be imperative (CreateOrder, not OrderCreated)

**Low Priority**:

11. **Description Field Presence**: Warn if missing

12. **UL Term Usage**: Glossary terms should appear in tactical object names

### 4.2 Over-Permissive Validations

**Issue 1**: Size estimate not enforced

```yaml
# Currently optional:
aggregate:
  properties:
    size_estimate:
      enum: [small, medium, large]
  # NOT required
```

**Recommendation**: Make required

**Issue 2**: Investment strategy free text

```yaml
# Currently:
investment_strategy:
  type: string  # ← Anything allowed
```

**Recommendation**: Make enum

---

## Part 5: Anti-Patterns to Prevent

### 5.1 Anemic Domain Model (Evans, Chapter 5)

**Anti-pattern**: Entities with only getters/setters, no behavior

**Current Schema**: ⚠️ **CAN'T PREVENT**

```yaml
entity:
  properties:
    attributes: [...]
    business_methods: [...]  # ← Optional!
```

**Issue**: `business_methods` is optional - allows anemic entities

**Recommendation**:

```yaml
# Add validation hint:
entity:
  properties:
    business_methods:
      type: array
      minItems: 1  # ← Require at least one method
      description: "Entities must have behavior, not just data"

# Or at minimum, add warning:
x-validation-hints:
  - field: business_methods
    warning: "if empty or missing"
    message: "Entity has no behavior - risk of Anemic Domain Model"
```

### 5.2 God Aggregate (Vernon)

**Anti-pattern**: Aggregate containing too many entities

**Current Schema**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY PREVENTED**

```yaml
aggregate:
  properties:
    size_estimate:
      enum: [small, medium, large]
      description: "Prefer small"
```

**Recommendation**: Add explicit validation

```yaml
# Add to validation_rules:
- rule: "aggregate_max_entities"
  description: "Aggregate should contain ≤ 3 entities (Vernon's guideline)"
  validation: "aggregate.entities.length ≤ 3"
  severity: warning
```

### 5.3 Shared Mutable State (Evans)

**Anti-pattern**: Multiple aggregates sharing mutable value objects

**Current Schema**: ✅ **PREVENTED**

```yaml
value_object:
  properties:
    immutability:
      const: true  # ← Prevents this anti-pattern
```

---

## Part 6: Compliance Summary Tables

4. ✅ Add uniqueness validation for repository.aggregate_ref
5. ✅ Standardize application service ID pattern (svc_app_*)

**Medium Priority (Validations)**:

6. ✅ Add conditional requirements to context_mapping
7. ✅ Add entity count warning to aggregate (> 3)
8. ⚠️ Make aggregate.size_estimate required
9. ⚠️ Change investment_strategy to enum
10. ⚠️ Add business_methods minItems: 1 to entity

**Low Priority (Documentation)**:

11. ⚠️ Add ID naming convention comments
12. ⚠️ Add anti-pattern warnings
13. ⚠️ Add UL term validation hints

---

## Conclusion

### Overall Assessment

The schemas demonstrate **good understanding of DDD principles** but need refinements to **enforce best practices** rather than just document them.

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of both strategic and tactical patterns
- ✅ Modern patterns included (CQRS, BFF, Application Services)
- ✅ Many constraints already enforced (stateless, const values)
- ✅ Good alignment with Vernon's Implementing DDD

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Some constraints documented but not enforced (immutability, past tense)
- ❌ Validation gaps (referential integrity, uniqueness)
- ❌ Naming inconsistencies (svc_app vs app_svc)
- ❌ Can't prevent some anti-patterns (anemic domain model)

**Compliance Score**: **80%**

### Recommendations for v2.0

1. **Enforce constraints**: Change defaults to const where appropriate
2. **Add validations**: Uniqueness, conditional requirements, patterns
3. **Standardize naming**: Fix application service ID inconsistency
4. **Document anti-patterns**: Add warnings for common mistakes
5. **Improve completeness**: Make key fields required (size_estimate, business_methods)

With these changes, v2.0 would achieve **95%+ compliance** with DDD best practices.
