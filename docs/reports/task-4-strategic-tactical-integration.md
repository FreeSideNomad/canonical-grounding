# Task 4: Strategic-Tactical Schema Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Analyst**: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
**Scope**: Analyze how strategic and tactical schemas should integrate, particularly around bounded_context

---

## Executive Summary

The `bounded_context` type appears in both strategic and tactical schemas with different purposes, creating a critical integration challenge. The current v1.x approach is inconsistent with DDD principles where "all tactical objects belong to one bounded context."

### Key Findings

- ❌ **Current State**: `bounded_context` defined in strategic schema only, referenced by ID from tactical
- ❌ **Problem**: Tactical objects scattered across multiple BCs in one document
- ✅ **Solution**: `bounded_context` as root in tactical schema, detailed definition in strategic

### Recommendation

**Option 2: Separate but Linked Schemas** - BoundedContext defined in strategic with minimal info, fully detailed in tactical as container for all tactical objects.

---

## Part 1: Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Strategic Schema: bounded_context Definition

```yaml
# strategic-ddd.schema.yaml
$defs:
  bounded_context:
    type: object
    required: [id, name, domain_ref]
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        pattern: "^bc_[a-z0-9_]+$"

      name:
        type: string

      domain_ref:
        type: string
        pattern: "^dom_[a-z0-9_]+$"

      description:
        type: string

      ubiquitous_language:
        type: object
        properties:
          glossary: [...]

      team_ownership:
        type: string

      # References to tactical objects (by ID only!)
      aggregates:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^agg_[a-z0-9_]+$"

      repositories:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^repo_[a-z0-9_]+$"

      domain_services:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^svc_dom_[a-z0-9_]+$"

      application_services:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^svc_app_[a-z0-9_]+$"

      domain_events:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          pattern: "^evt_[a-z0-9_]+$"
```

**Purpose in Strategic Schema**:
- Defines bounded context boundaries
- Shows which tactical objects belong to which BC (by ID reference)
- Part of system architecture view
- Shows relationships between BCs via context mappings

### 1.2 Tactical Schema: All Types Reference BC

```yaml
# tactical-ddd.schema.yaml
$defs:
  aggregate:
    type: object
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        pattern: "^agg_[a-z0-9_]+$"

      bounded_context_ref:  # ← Every tactical type has this!
        type: string
        pattern: "^bc_[a-z0-9_]+$"
        description: "Reference to BoundedContext from strategic schema"

  entity:
    properties:
      bounded_context_ref:  # ← Repeated
        type: string
        pattern: "^bc_[a-z0-9_]+$"

  value_object:
    properties:
      bounded_context_ref:  # ← Repeated
        type: string
        pattern: "^bc_[a-z0-9_]+$"

  # ... EVERY tactical type has bounded_context_ref
```

**Purpose in Tactical Schema**:
- Links tactical object back to its bounded context
- Currently just an ID string reference
- No structural containment

### 1.3 Current Problem Identified

**Issue**: "In essence bounded_context should be a top level object of tactical DDD but it also should be in strategic DDD. In essence all object/types in tactical belong to one bounded_context however this is not explicit."

**Current Anti-Pattern**:

```yaml
# Hypothetical tactical schema instance (v1.x):
aggregates:
  - id: agg_customer
    bounded_context_ref: bc_customer_profile  # ← BC1
    # ...

  - id: agg_address
    bounded_context_ref: bc_customer_profile  # ← BC1

  - id: agg_order
    bounded_context_ref: bc_order_mgmt  # ← BC2 (different!)

  - id: agg_product
    bounded_context_ref: bc_catalog  # ← BC3 (different!)

entities:
  - id: ent_customer
    bounded_context_ref: bc_customer_profile
    aggregate_ref: agg_customer

  - id: ent_order_line
    bounded_context_ref: bc_order_mgmt
    aggregate_ref: agg_order
```

**Problems**:
1. ❌ **Multiple BCs in one document** - violates single responsibility
2. ❌ **No containment hierarchy** - BC-to-tactical relationship not explicit
3. ❌ **Validation gap** - can't enforce "aggregate belongs to declared BC"
4. ❌ **Mental model mismatch** - tactical work happens within ONE BC, not across many
5. ❌ **Documentation challenge** - can't generate BC-scoped docs
6. ❌ **Referential integrity** - where is `bc_customer_profile` defined?

**Root Cause**: Tactical schema has no root object (see Task 2).

---

## Part 2: Integration Options Analysis

### Option 1: BoundedContext as Tactical Root ❌

**Approach**: Move bounded_context definition to tactical schema, reference from strategic

```yaml
# tactical-ddd.schema.yaml (v2.0)
type: object
properties:
  bounded_context:
    $ref: "#/$defs/BoundedContext"

required: [bounded_context]

$defs:
  BoundedContext:
    type: object
    required: [id, name, domain_ref]
    properties:
      id: { $ref: "#/$defs/BcId" }
      name:
        type: string
      domain_ref:
        type: string
        pattern: "^dom_[a-z0-9_]+$"
        description: "Reference to domain in strategic schema"

      # Full tactical content nested here
      aggregates:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/Aggregate" }

      entities:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/Entity" }

      # ... all tactical types

  Aggregate:
    type: object
    properties:
      id: { $ref: "#/$defs/AggId" }
      # NO bounded_context_ref needed - implicit from parent!
```

```yaml
# strategic-ddd.schema.yaml (v2.0)
$defs:
  bounded_context:
    type: object
    required: [id, name, domain_ref]
    properties:
      id: { $ref: "#/$defs/BcId" }
      name:
        type: string
      domain_ref: { $ref: "#/$defs/DomId" }

      # Reference to tactical schema
      tactical_model_uri:
        type: string
        format: uri
        description: "URI to tactical schema document for this BC"
```

#### Pros
✅ Clear ownership: Tactical schema owns BC definition
✅ DDD alignment: "All tactical objects belong to one BC"
✅ No duplication: BC defined once
✅ Implicit context: No `bounded_context_ref` needed in children

#### Cons
❌ Strategic schema loses detail: Can't show BC contents at strategic level
❌ Circular dependency: Strategic references tactical via URI
❌ Two sources of truth: BC exists in both places
❌ Discoverability: Strategic view incomplete without tactical
❌ **Critical**: Strategic DDD needs BC info (ubiquitous language, team ownership, boundaries) WITHOUT tactical details

**Verdict**: ❌ **REJECTED** - Strategic DDD needs BC concept independently

---

### Option 2: Separate but Linked Schemas ✅ (Recommended)

**Approach**: BoundedContext defined in BOTH schemas with different levels of detail

#### Strategic Schema: BC Definition (Boundaries and Relationships)

```yaml
# strategic-ddd.schema.yaml
$defs:
  BoundedContext:
    type: object
    required: [id, name, domain_ref]
    properties:
      id: { $ref: "#/$defs/BcId" }

      name:
        type: string
        description: "BC name from ubiquitous language"

      domain_ref: { $ref: "#/$defs/DomId" }

      description:
        type: string

      # STRATEGIC CONCERNS
      ubiquitous_language:
        type: object
        properties:
          glossary:
            type: array
            items: { $ref: "#/$defs/GlossaryEntry" }

      team_ownership:
        type: string

      strategic_importance:
        type: string
        enum: [critical, important, standard]

      # TACTICAL SUMMARY (IDs only - actual definitions in tactical schema)
      tactical_summary:
        type: object
        description: "Summary of tactical contents (IDs only)"
        properties:
          aggregate_count:
            type: integer
            description: "Number of aggregates in this BC"

          key_aggregates:
            type: array
            description: "Most important aggregates (IDs)"
            items: { $ref: "#/$defs/AggId" }
            maxItems: 5

          has_application_services:
            type: boolean

          has_domain_services:
            type: boolean

          event_count:
            type: integer

      # Link to full tactical model
      tactical_model:
        type: object
        properties:
          file_path:
            type: string
            description: "Path to tactical schema file for this BC"
            example: "tactical/bc_customer_profile.yaml"

          last_updated:
            type: string
            format: date-time
```

**Purpose**: Strategic view focuses on BC boundaries, relationships, team ownership, ubiquitous language

#### Tactical Schema: BC as Container (Full Implementation Details)

```yaml
# tactical-ddd.schema.yaml
type: object
properties:
  bounded_context:
    $ref: "#/$defs/BoundedContext"

required: [bounded_context]

$defs:
  BoundedContext:
    type: object
    required: [id, name, domain_ref]
    properties:
      id: { $ref: "#/$defs/BcId" }

      name:
        type: string

      domain_ref:
        type: string
        pattern: "^dom_[a-z0-9_]+$"
        description: "Reference to domain in strategic schema"

      # FULL TACTICAL CONTENTS
      aggregates:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/Aggregate" }
        description: "All aggregates within this bounded context"

      entities:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/Entity" }

      value_objects:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/ValueObject" }

      repositories:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/Repository" }

      domain_services:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/DomainService" }

      application_services:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/ApplicationService" }

      domain_events:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/DomainEvent" }

      command_interfaces:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/CommandInterface" }

      query_interfaces:
        type: array
        items: { $ref: "#/$defs/QueryInterface" }

  # All tactical types - NO bounded_context_ref field needed
  Aggregate:
    type: object
    properties:
      id: { $ref: "#/$defs/AggId" }
      name:
        type: string
      # NO bounded_context_ref - implicit from parent container
```

**Purpose**: Tactical view focuses on aggregate design, invariants, implementation details

#### Pros
✅ **Separation of concerns**: Strategic = boundaries/relationships, Tactical = implementation
✅ **DDD alignment**: Both strategic and tactical need BC concept
✅ **No circular dependency**: Strategic and tactical are independent
✅ **Implicit context**: Tactical objects don't need `bounded_context_ref`
✅ **Flexibility**: Can model strategic without tactical details
✅ **Scalability**: One tactical file per BC (manageable size)

#### Cons
⚠️ **Duplication**: BC ID, name, domain_ref in both schemas
⚠️ **Sync required**: BC identity must match between strategic and tactical
⚠️ **Two files per BC**: strategic-model.yaml + bc_customer_profile.yaml

**Mitigation**:
- Validation rule: BC IDs must match between strategic summary and tactical file
- Tooling: Generate tactical summary from tactical file automatically
- Convention: File naming `tactical/bc_{id}.yaml` enforces consistency

**Verdict**: ✅ **RECOMMENDED** - Best aligns with DDD mental model

---

### Option 3: Combined Schema with Partitions ❌

**Approach**: Single unified schema with strategic and tactical sections

```yaml
# ddd-unified.schema.yaml
type: object
properties:
  system:
    $ref: "#/$defs/System"

  domains:
    type: array
    items: { $ref: "#/$defs/Domain" }

  bounded_contexts_strategic:
    type: array
    description: "Strategic view of bounded contexts"
    items: { $ref: "#/$defs/BoundedContext_Strategic" }

  bounded_contexts_tactical:
    type: array
    description: "Tactical implementation of bounded contexts"
    items: { $ref: "#/$defs/BoundedContext_Tactical" }

$defs:
  BoundedContext_Strategic:
    # Strategic properties

  BoundedContext_Tactical:
    # Tactical properties
```

#### Pros
✅ Single file
✅ All info in one place

#### Cons
❌ Schema becomes massive (1000+ lines)
❌ Mixes concerns (strategic + tactical)
❌ Hard to maintain
❌ Violates single responsibility
❌ Can't work on strategic without tactical and vice versa

**Verdict**: ❌ **REJECTED** - Violates separation of concerns

---

### Option 4: Tactical Nested Within Strategic ❌

**Approach**: Embed full tactical definitions inside strategic BC

```yaml
# strategic-ddd.schema.yaml
$defs:
  BoundedContext:
    properties:
      id: { $ref: "#/$defs/BcId" }
      name:
        type: string

      # Strategic concerns
      ubiquitous_language: { ... }
      team_ownership:
        type: string

      # Tactical contents nested inside
      tactical:
        type: object
        properties:
          aggregates:
            type: array
            items: { $ref: "tactical-ddd.schema.yaml#/$defs/Aggregate" }

          entities: [...]
          # ... all tactical types
```

#### Pros
✅ Clear hierarchy: Tactical nested under strategic

#### Cons
❌ Cross-schema references (see Task 3 - complex)
❌ Mixes strategic and tactical concerns
❌ Strategic schema becomes huge
❌ Violates separation of concerns
❌ Can't edit tactical without touching strategic file

**Verdict**: ❌ **REJECTED** - Too tightly coupled

### 3.5 Validation Strategy

#### Cross-Schema Validation Rules

**Rule 1**: BC IDs must exist in strategic schema

```yaml
# In tactical/bc_customer_profile.yaml
bounded_context:
  id: bc_customer_profile  # ← Must exist in strategic-model.yaml
```

**Validation**:
- Extract all BC IDs from strategic model
- Verify tactical model BC ID is in that list
- Error if not found

**Rule 2**: Domain reference must be consistent

```yaml
# In strategic-model.yaml
bounded_contexts:
  - id: bc_customer_profile
    domain_ref: dom_customer  # ← Strategic says BC is in dom_customer

# In tactical/bc_customer_profile.yaml
bounded_context:
  id: bc_customer_profile
  domain_ref: dom_customer  # ← Must match!
```

**Validation**:
- Compare domain_ref between strategic and tactical
- Error if mismatch

**Rule 3**: Tactical summary should match actual contents

```yaml
# In strategic-model.yaml
tactical_summary:
  aggregate_count: 2  # ← Claims 2 aggregates

# In tactical/bc_customer_profile.yaml
aggregates:
  - agg_customer
  - agg_customer_preferences  # ← Actually has 2 aggregates ✓
```

**Validation** (automated tool):
- Count aggregates in tactical file
- Compare to strategic summary
- Warn if mismatch (not error - summary can be outdated)

#### Validation Tool

```python
# tools/validate_strategic_tactical_consistency.py

def validate_consistency(strategic_file, tactical_dir):
    strategic = load_yaml(strategic_file)
    errors = []

    for bc in strategic['system']['bounded_contexts']:
        bc_id = bc['id']

        # Check tactical file exists
        tactical_file = f"{tactical_dir}/{bc_id}.yaml"
        if not os.path.exists(tactical_file):
            errors.append(f"Missing tactical file for {bc_id}")
            continue

        tactical = load_yaml(tactical_file)

        # Rule 1: BC ID matches
        if tactical['bounded_context']['id'] != bc_id:
            errors.append(f"BC ID mismatch: strategic={bc_id}, tactical={tactical['bounded_context']['id']}")

        # Rule 2: Domain ref matches
        if tactical['bounded_context']['domain_ref'] != bc['domain_ref']:
            errors.append(f"Domain ref mismatch for {bc_id}")

        # Rule 3: Tactical summary check (warning only)
        actual_count = len(tactical['bounded_context']['aggregates'])
        expected_count = bc['tactical_summary']['aggregate_count']
        if actual_count != expected_count:
            print(f"⚠️  Warning: {bc_id} aggregate count mismatch (strategic={expected_count}, tactical={actual_count})")

    return errors
```

### 3.6 Benefits Summary

#### For Strategic Modeling
✅ Can design system boundaries without tactical details
✅ Shows high-level BC relationships
✅ Lightweight - one file for whole system
✅ Team ownership and ubiquitous language captured
✅ Context mapping relationships clear

#### For Tactical Modeling
✅ Focus on one BC at a time
✅ No `bounded_context_ref` pollution on every type
✅ Clear containment hierarchy
✅ One file per BC (manageable size)
✅ Can work on BC in isolation

#### For DDD Alignment
✅ Strategic and tactical are separate concerns (DDD principle)
✅ BC is central to both (DDD principle)
✅ Tactical objects belong to one BC (DDD principle)
✅ Referential integrity enforceable

#### For Documentation Generation
✅ Strategic doc: System overview with BC boundaries
✅ Tactical doc: One chapter per BC with full details
✅ Can generate either independently
✅ Can generate combined with cross-references

## Part 4: Migration Impact

### 4.1 Breaking Changes

**Strategic Schema**:
- BC definition changes (add tactical_summary)
- aggregate/repository/etc arrays change to IDs only
- **Impact**: Medium - need to update strategic models

**Tactical Schema**:
- Add root `bounded_context` property
- Remove `bounded_context_ref` from all types
- **Impact**: HIGH - significant restructuring required

### 4.2 Migration Process

**Step 1**: Split existing tactical models by BC

```python
# Current v1.x tactical model (hypothetical):
{
  "aggregates": [
    {"id": "agg_customer", "bounded_context_ref": "bc_customer_profile"},
    {"id": "agg_address", "bounded_context_ref": "bc_customer_profile"},
    {"id": "agg_order", "bounded_context_ref": "bc_order_mgmt"},
  ],
  "entities": [...]
}

# Split into multiple files:
# bc_customer_profile.yaml:
{
  "bounded_context": {
    "id": "bc_customer_profile",
    "aggregates": [
      {"id": "agg_customer"},  # ← No bounded_context_ref
      {"id": "agg_address"},
    ]
  }
}

# bc_order_mgmt.yaml:
{
  "bounded_context": {
    "id": "bc_order_mgmt",
    "aggregates": [
      {"id": "agg_order"},  # ← No bounded_context_ref
    ]
  }
}
```

**Step 2**: Update strategic model

```python
# Add tactical_summary to each BC
{
  "id": "bc_customer_profile",
  "tactical_summary": {
    "aggregate_count": 2,
    "key_aggregates": ["agg_customer", "agg_address"]
  },
  "tactical_model": {
    "file_path": "tactical/bc_customer_profile.yaml"
  }
}
```

**Step 3**: Remove `bounded_context_ref` from all tactical types

---

## Conclusion

**Recommended Approach**: **Option 2 - Separate but Linked Schemas**

**Implementation**:
1. **Strategic schema** defines BC with strategic concerns (boundaries, language, team, relationships)
2. **Tactical schema** uses BC as root container for all tactical objects
3. **Validation tools** ensure BC IDs and domain refs are consistent
4. **File structure**: One strategic model, one tactical file per BC

**Benefits**:
- ✅ DDD-aligned
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ Scalable (one file per BC)
- ✅ Manageable size
- ✅ Clear ownership
- ✅ Supports both strategic and tactical work independently

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- ⚠️ Duplication of BC identity (acceptable - different purposes)
- ⚠️ Need validation tooling (necessary for quality)
- ⚠️ Multiple files (beneficial - smaller, focused files)

This approach best reflects DDD principles and real-world usage patterns.
