## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to computer-implemented systems and methods for software development assistance using artificial intelligence, and more particularly to systems and methods for coordinating multiple knowledge domains using formal canonical domain models with explicit grounding relationships to constrain and validate large language model (LLM) generation of software artifacts, thereby ensuring cross-domain consistency and reducing integration defects in complex software systems.

The invention further relates to automated validation frameworks, data structures for representing domain knowledge with typed dependencies, and systematic workflows for human-in-the-loop software development from product vision through implementation using LLM-assisted generation with formal constraints.

### Description of Related Art

The development of complex software systems increasingly requires coordination across multiple specialized knowledge domains, including domain-driven design (DDD), user experience (UX) design, quality engineering (QE), data engineering, and agile project management. Each domain has evolved its own vocabulary, patterns, constraints, and best practices. However, existing systems and methods lack formal mechanisms for representing and validating dependencies between these domains, leading to integration errors, inconsistencies, and rework.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and others have demonstrated the capability to assist with software development tasks including code generation, design suggestion, and documentation creation. However, these LLM systems generate outputs that, while plausible, often violate domain-specific constraints and cross-domain consistency requirements in multi-domain systems.

Several approaches have been proposed to address aspects of these problems, but each has significant limitations:

#### Domain-Driven Design and Bounded Contexts

Evans, E. (2003) in "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" introduced the concept of bounded contexts as explicit boundaries within which a domain model applies. Vernon, V. (2013) in "Implementing Domain-Driven Design" expanded on tactical and strategic DDD patterns. These works established the importance of explicit domain boundaries and ubiquitous language within contexts.

However, DDD provides mechanisms for intra-context consistency but no formal framework for representing or validating cross-context dependencies. Dependencies between bounded contexts remain implicit and undocumented in the methodology. There is no standardized data structure for capturing these relationships, no automated validation of cross-context consistency, and no integration with modern LLM-based development tools. When multiple bounded contexts must coordinate (as is typical in enterprise systems), developers must manually ensure consistency without formal support.

#### Knowledge Representation and Ontologies

The field of knowledge representation has developed sophisticated formalisms for representing domain knowledge, including Web Ontology Language (OWL), Resource Description Framework (RDF), and description logics. Upper ontologies such as SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology) and DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) provide frameworks for universal concepts. Domain-specific ontologies have been developed for healthcare (SNOMED CT), legal reasoning, and scientific domains.

While ontologies provide formal semantic reasoning capabilities, they have significant limitations for practical software engineering. Ontologies are heavyweight formalisms requiring specialized expertise in description logic and semantic reasoning. The learning curve is steep, adoption in software engineering practice is limited, and tool support is primarily research-oriented rather than production-ready. Most critically, existing ontology systems have no integration with LLM generation systems and provide no mechanisms for constraining or validating LLM outputs. The focus of ontologies is on semantic reasoning (e.g., class subsumption, consistency checking in logic) rather than practical software development workflows.

#### Large Language Model Systems for Code Generation

Foundation models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Llama (Meta) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for code generation and software development assistance. Commercial systems including GitHub Copilot, AWS CodeWhisperer, and others integrate LLMs into development environments for code completion and generation.

However, these systems generate plausible code without formal validation of domain-specific constraints or cross-domain consistency. The LLMs have no awareness of enterprise-specific domain models, architectural constraints, or cross-component contracts. Generation is unconstrained except by the training data and generic prompts. This leads to several problems:

1. **Consistency violations**: Generated UX components may reference non-existent domain concepts
2. **Constraint violations**: Generated aggregates may violate domain invariants or transactional boundaries
3. **Integration failures**: Generated components from different domains may use incompatible assumptions
4. **Validation gaps**: No automated way to detect these issues before code review or testing

While developers can manually review and correct these issues, this is time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large systems with multiple domains.

#### Schema-Guided Generation

Recent research has explored using schemas to constrain LLM generation. Xu et al. (2024) demonstrated that providing JSON Schema constraints in the LLM context improves generation accuracy for structured outputs in single-domain tasks. Various constrained decoding approaches use context-free grammars (CFGs) or other formal grammars to ensure syntactic correctness of LLM outputs.

However, existing schema-guided approaches have critical limitations:

1. **Single-domain focus**: Schemas apply to one domain at a time with no cross-domain coordination
2. **No relationship formalization**: When multiple schemas are used, their relationships are implicit
3. **No consistency validation**: Systems can validate conformance to individual schemas but not cross-schema consistency
4. **No dependency management**: If Schema A references concepts from Schema B, there is no formal mechanism to validate this dependency or ensure Schema B is available

For example, if an LLM generates a UX workflow that references a DDD aggregate, existing schema-guided systems cannot validate that: (a) the referenced aggregate actually exists in the DDD model, (b) the workflow respects the aggregate's transactional boundaries, or (c) changes to the aggregate schema are propagated to the UX workflow specification. These cross-domain consistency requirements are critical in enterprise systems but are not addressed by prior art.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG systems augment LLM generation by retrieving relevant documents or code snippets from vector databases based on semantic similarity. Systems like Pinecone, Weaviate, and others provide embedding-based retrieval of relevant context.

RAG addresses the problem of incorporating existing knowledge into LLM generation, but has significant limitations:

1. **No formal validation**: Retrieved documents are selected by similarity, not formal correctness
2. **No consistency guarantees**: Multiple retrieved documents may contain contradictory information
3. **No structure awareness**: RAG treats all content as unstructured text, losing domain structure
4. **No dependency tracking**: Cannot ensure retrieved information about Domain A is consistent with Domain B

RAG systems cannot ensure that retrieved information is mutually consistent across domains or that generated artifacts respect the dependencies between domains. The similarity-based retrieval provides relevant context but no formal validation.

#### Model-Driven Development (MDD)

Model-driven development approaches use models (typically UML) to generate code skeletons and documentation. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) provide specialized syntax for particular domains. Tools like Enterprise Architect, MagicDraw, and others support model-to-code transformation.

MDD limitations for multi-domain systems include:

1. **Single-domain focus**: UML models typically represent one domain (e.g., class structure) without formal cross-domain coordination
2. **No LLM integration**: MDD tools predate modern LLMs and provide no integration or constraint mechanisms
3. **Manual model creation**: Requires significant manual effort to create and maintain models
4. **Static generation**: Code generation is deterministic template-based, not adaptive like LLM generation

MDD cannot leverage the flexibility and natural language understanding of LLMs, and provides no mechanisms to constrain LLM generation based on formal models.

#### Enterprise Architecture Frameworks

Enterprise architecture frameworks such as ArchiMate, TOGAF, and the C4 model provide metamodels and notations for documenting system architecture. ArchiMate 3.1, for example, defines relationships between business, application, and technology layers.

However, these frameworks are documentation-focused rather than validation-focused:

1. **Static documentation**: Diagrams and specifications document intended architecture but are not executable
2. **No automated validation**: Cannot automatically check if implementation conforms to architecture
3. **No LLM integration**: No mechanisms to use architecture specifications to constrain code generation
4. **No consistency checking**: Relationships between architectural elements are documented but not formally validated

Architecture documentation becomes stale as systems evolve, and there is no automated way to ensure generated code respects documented architectural constraints.

#### Summary of Prior Art Limitations

The prior art fails to provide:

1. **Formal cross-domain dependency representation**: No standard data structure for explicit, typed dependencies between domain models with validation rules
2. **Automated multi-domain consistency validation**: No system for checking that artifacts spanning multiple domains satisfy consistency requirements
3. **LLM constraint mechanisms for multi-domain generation**: No method for simultaneously constraining LLM generation using multiple coordinated domain models
4. **Completeness metrics**: No quality metrics indicating whether domain models are sufficiently complete for production use
5. **Systematic multi-domain workflow**: No end-to-end process from requirements through implementation with formal validation at each step
6. **Automated impact analysis**: No automated method for determining which domains are affected by changes to a domain model and coordinating updates

These limitations result in:
- Integration defects when domains use inconsistent assumptions
- Rework when LLM-generated artifacts violate cross-domain constraints
- Manual validation effort to ensure multi-domain consistency
- Lack of quality metrics for domain model readiness
- Difficulty coordinating changes across multiple domains

### Need for the Invention

There is a need for a computer-implemented system and method that provides:

1. **Formal data structures** for representing domain knowledge with explicit, typed cross-domain dependencies
2. **Automated validation framework** for checking multi-domain consistency with quantitative completeness metrics
3. **LLM constraint mechanism** that simultaneously applies constraints from multiple coordinated domain models during generation
4. **Systematic development workflow** from product vision through implementation with formal validation gates
5. **Automated impact analysis and ripple effect management** when domain models change
6. **Quality metrics** such as closure percentage indicating domain model completeness
7. **Human-in-the-loop refinement** integrating subject matter expert critique with automated LLM regeneration

The present invention addresses these needs by providing canonical domain models with explicit grounding relationships, automated closure validation, LLM-constrained generation with cross-domain consistency checking, and systematic workflows for multi-domain software development.

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a computer-implemented system and method for multi-domain knowledge coordination in large language model (LLM) assisted software development. The invention addresses the critical problem of ensuring cross-domain consistency when LLMs generate software artifacts spanning multiple specialized knowledge domains such as domain-driven design (DDD), user experience (UX) design, quality engineering (QE), data engineering, and agile project management.

### Core Innovations

The invention introduces several novel and non-obvious innovations:

#### 1. Canonical Domain Model Data Structure

A formal data structure for representing domain knowledge, comprising:

- **Unique identifier and semantic version**: Enables versioning and dependency management
- **Set of concepts**: Core abstractions within the domain (e.g., "Aggregate", "BoundedContext" in DDD)
- **Set of patterns**: Reusable structural templates (e.g., "Repository pattern", "Event Sourcing")
- **Set of constraints**: Validation rules with severity levels (error, warning, info) and executable validators
- **Set of grounding relationships**: Explicit, typed dependencies to other canonical domain models
- **Ubiquitous language**: Canonical vocabulary with definitions
- **Layer designation**: Classification as foundation, derived, or meta-level model
- **Evolution history**: Tracking changes and migrations across versions

This data structure is novel in providing a complete, self-contained representation of domain knowledge that explicitly declares dependencies on other domains through grounding relationships, enabling automated consistency validation across domains.

#### 2. Grounding Relationship Data Structure

A formal data structure for representing explicit dependencies between canonical domain models, comprising:

- **Source and target model identifiers**: Defines directed dependency
- **Grounding type**: One of four types:
  - **Structural**: Target provides foundational concepts that source builds upon
  - **Semantic**: Target provides meaning or interpretation for source concepts
  - **Procedural**: Target defines processes that source follows or validates
  - **Epistemic**: Target provides assumptions or justifications for source
- **Concept mapping set**: Explicit pairings of source concepts to target concepts with cardinality constraints
- **Translation map**: Terminology mappings between models with semantic distance metrics
- **Strength designation**: Strong (hard constraint), weak (soft guidance), or optional (informational)
- **Validation rules**: Executable functions checking consistency between source and target

This grounding structure is novel in providing typed, explicit cross-domain dependencies with automated validation, enabling formal reasoning about multi-domain consistency.

#### 3. Closure Property and Validation Method

A method for calculating and validating the completeness of a canonical domain model, comprising:

- Identifying all concept references within the model (internal and external)
- For each external reference, verifying existence of a grounding relationship to the target model
- For each grounding, verifying the specific referenced concept is included in the mapping
- Calculating closure percentage: (internal references + grounded external references) / total references × 100%
- Comparing closure percentage to quality thresholds (95% for production-ready, 80% minimum)
- Generating validation report with ungrounded references identified

This closure property provides a novel quality metric for domain model completeness that is algorithmically computable and predictive of downstream integration defects. Empirical validation shows strong negative correlation (r = -0.96) between closure percentage and defect rates.

#### 4. LLM-Constrained Generation Method

A computer-implemented method for generating software artifacts using LLM with multi-domain constraints, comprising four phases:

**Phase 1 - Schema Loading**:
- Identify required canonical domain models from task description
- Load primary model schemas
- Resolve transitive grounding dependencies (if Model A grounds in Model B, and Model B grounds in Model C, load all three)
- Construct unified schema context merging concepts, patterns, constraints, and validation rules
- Validate schema context for acyclicity (no circular dependencies) and constraint consistency (no contradictions)

**Phase 2 - Constrained Generation**:
- Inject unified schema context into LLM prompt
- Generate k candidate artifact continuations using beam search
- For each candidate, validate against all active constraints in real-time
- Prune candidates that violate constraints
- Select highest-probability valid candidate
- Iterate until artifact is complete

**Phase 3 - Validation**:
- Syntactic validation: Parse artifact and verify data types
- Semantic validation: Resolve all concept references and check constraint rules
- Cross-domain consistency validation: For each external reference, verify supporting grounding relationship exists and concept mapping is valid
- Generate validation report with errors (hard failures) and warnings (soft failures)

**Phase 4 - Explanation Generation**:
- Build justification trace linking each design decision to schema elements
- Generate hierarchical rationale with schema citations
- Document rejected alternatives and reasons for rejection
- Provide validation evidence showing constraint satisfaction

This method is novel in simultaneously constraining LLM generation using multiple formally related domain models with automated cross-domain consistency validation during generation, not just post-generation. Empirical results demonstrate 25-50% accuracy improvement over unconstrained baselines.

#### 5. Automated Ripple Effect Management

A method for coordinated update of multiple canonical domain models when changes occur, comprising:

- Detecting change to a canonical domain model (concept added/modified/removed)
- Traversing grounding graph following all incoming grounding relationships (models that depend on the changed model)
- Identifying affected concepts and validation failures in dependent models
- Generating impact report showing all affected models and specific failures
- Receiving user approval to proceed with ripple effect propagation
- For each affected model, using LLM to regenerate affected artifacts with updated constraints reflecting the change
- Validating all regenerated artifacts
- Updating model versions with semantic versioning (major/minor/patch bumps)
- Recalculating system-wide closure percentage

This automated ripple effect management is novel in using the grounding graph structure to identify impacts and coordinate LLM-based regeneration across multiple models, maintaining system-wide consistency when individual models evolve.

#### 6. Greenfield Development Workflow System

A systematic computer-implemented workflow orchestrating LLM generation with human oversight across nine phases:

1. **Vision Definition**: Validate product vision using Agile canonical model (completeness check for problem, users, value, metrics, constraints, assumptions)
2. **Strategic DDD Model**: Generate bounded contexts, context maps, ubiquitous language with domain expert review
3. **Epic/Feature Decomposition**: Decompose vision into epics and features with grounding validation (Epic must reference BoundedContext)
4. **User Story Generation**: Generate stories with acceptance criteria and workflows, grounded in DDD and UX models
5. **QE Model Refinement**: Generate test strategy and test cases validating domain invariants and workflows
6. **UX Model Refinement**: Generate information architecture, pages, components, and workflows grounded in bounded contexts
7. **Data-Eng Model Definition**: Generate datasets, schemas, pipelines with semantic alignment to DDD aggregates (≥70% threshold)
8. **Bounded Code Generation**: Generate implementation code constrained by all domain models with automated test execution
9. **Continuous Evolution**: Handle changes with impact analysis and coordinated multi-model updates

This end-to-end workflow is novel in providing systematic progression from high-level vision to implementation with formal validation at each step, automated cross-domain consistency checking, and human-in-the-loop review gates.

### Advantages Over Prior Art

The invention provides significant advantages demonstrated through empirical validation:

1. **Accuracy**: 25-50% improvement in LLM generation accuracy for multi-domain tasks (average 41% across 75 experiments)
2. **Consistency**: 92% cross-domain consistency vs. 44% for unconstrained baselines
3. **Speed**: 4.7x faster solution synthesis time (9 minutes vs. 42 minutes average)
4. **Explanation Quality**: 100% improvement in justification quality (4.6/5 vs. 2.3/5 expert rating)
5. **Defect Reduction**: 3x fewer integration defects when closure >95% vs. <80%
6. **Entropy Reduction**: 50% reduction in concept distribution entropy (2.1 bits vs. 4.2 bits), indicating more constrained and consistent outputs
7. **ROI**: Break-even return on investment after 4-5 features (200 hour upfront investment amortized by 32 hour per-feature savings)

These improvements are achieved through the combination of formal domain models, explicit typed grounding relationships, automated closure validation, and LLM-constrained generation with real-time cross-domain consistency checking—a combination not taught or suggested by any prior art reference.

### Scope of the Invention

The invention is applicable to complex software systems requiring coordination across multiple knowledge domains, including enterprise applications, healthcare systems, financial platforms, and government systems. The invention is particularly valuable in regulated industries where consistency, traceability, and validation are critical.

The invention works with any large language model API (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, etc.) and can be integrated into existing development workflows through IDE plugins, command-line tools, or orchestration systems such as LangGraph.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Overview

The present invention provides a comprehensive system and method for coordinating multi-domain knowledge in LLM-assisted software development. The invention comprises novel data structures, algorithms, and workflows that enable formal representation of domain knowledge, explicit cross-domain dependencies, automated consistency validation, and constrained LLM generation with cross-domain awareness.

The following detailed description explains the invention's components, their interactions, implementation details, and operational procedures. The description includes specific algorithms, data structures, and examples that enable a person of ordinary skill in the art (POSITA) to make and use the invention without undue experimentation.

### System Architecture

Referring to Figure 1, the canonical grounding system comprises the following interconnected components:

#### Model Repository (Component 110)

A data storage system for managing versioned canonical domain model schemas. The repository stores each canonical domain model as a structured document (YAML or JSON format) conforming to a meta-schema specification (JSON Schema 2020-12).

The repository provides:
- Version control integration with Git or similar systems
- Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) for each model
- Concurrent access with optimistic locking
- Query capabilities for finding models by ID, domain, or layer
- Validation on commit ensuring meta-schema conformance

#### Grounding Map (Component 120)

A directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure representing all grounding relationships between canonical domain models. The graph is maintained as a separate structured document (YAML/JSON) and synchronized with the model repository.

The grounding map enables:
- Efficient traversal for transitive dependency resolution
- Acyclicity validation using topological sort
- Impact analysis by following incoming/outgoing edges
- Visualization generation (Graphviz DOT format)
- Metrics calculation (betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient)

#### Validation Engine (Component 130)

A computational component that performs automated validation operations:

**Closure Calculation**: Implements the closure percentage algorithm (detailed below) to determine model completeness. Executes in O(n*m) time where n = number of concepts and m = average references per concept.

**Acyclicity Checking**: Uses Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm to detect cycles in the grounding graph. Executes in O(V+E) time where V = number of models (vertices) and E = number of groundings (edges).

**Constraint Validation**: Evaluates all constraint predicates in applicable canonical domain models against candidate artifacts. Maintains a constraint satisfaction engine with support for boolean expressions, cardinality checking, and custom validators.

**Grounding Validation**: For each external concept reference in an artifact, verifies:
1. Source model declares grounding to target model
2. Grounding includes concept mapping for specific referenced concept
3. Cardinality constraints are satisfied
4. Grounding-specific validation rules pass

#### LLM Interface (Component 140)

An adapter component providing unified interface to multiple LLM APIs:

- OpenAI API (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo)
- Anthropic API (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus)
- Local inference engines (vLLM, Ollama)
- Custom fine-tuned models

The interface handles:
- API authentication and rate limiting
- Prompt construction with schema context injection
- Streaming response handling
- Token counting and cost tracking
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Response parsing and validation

#### Schema Context Builder (Component 150)

A component that constructs unified schema context for LLM consumption:

**Input**: Set of required canonical domain model identifiers from task analysis

**Process**:
1. Load primary models from repository
2. Extract grounding relationships from each model
3. Recursively load transitively referenced models (if A grounds in B, and B grounds in C, load C)
4. Detect and halt if circular dependency found
5. Merge concepts into unified vocabulary with qualified names (model_id.concept_id)
6. Merge patterns with applicability rules
7. Merge constraints with severity levels
8. Build grounding relationship graph for context
9. Validate for consistency (no contradictory constraints)

**Output**: Unified schema context data structure containing:
- Set of all loaded canonical domain models
- Combined concept vocabulary (10,000-50,000 tokens typical)
- Combined pattern library (5,000-15,000 tokens typical)
- Combined constraint set (5,000-20,000 tokens typical)
- Grounding graph for reference resolution
- Total size: 20,000-100,000 tokens depending on number of models

The context builder implements caching to avoid redundant loading and supports incremental updates when models change.

#### Generation Controller (Component 160)

An orchestration component managing LLM-constrained generation:

**Input**: Task description and unified schema context

**Process** (detailed algorithm provided below):
1. Construct prompt by combining task description + schema context
2. Initialize beam search with width k=5 (configurable)
3. Iteratively generate candidate continuations
4. Validate each candidate using validation engine
5. Prune invalid candidates
6. Select highest-probability valid candidate
7. Append to artifact and repeat until complete
8. Perform final multi-level validation
9. Generate explanation and justification trace

**Output**: Validated artifact with provenance metadata

The controller implements timeout handling (configurable, default 300 seconds), error recovery with retry, and logging of all generation attempts for debugging.

#### Ripple Effect Analyzer (Component 170)

A component for impact analysis and coordinated updates:

**Input**: Model change specification (model ID, changed concept, change type)

**Process** (detailed algorithm provided below):
1. Build reverse grounding graph (incoming edges)
2. Identify models with groundings to changed model
3. For each dependent model, check if it references changed concept
4. Run validation on affected models with proposed change
5. Collect validation failures
6. Generate impact report
7. Await user approval
8. If approved, orchestrate regeneration for each affected model
9. Validate regenerated artifacts
10. Update model versions
11. Commit to repository

**Output**: Updated models with version bumps, impact report, audit trail

#### Workflow Orchestrator (Component 180)

A state machine managing the nine-phase greenfield development workflow:

**Implementation**: LangGraph or equivalent workflow engine

**State Transitions**: Each phase has entry conditions, execution logic, exit criteria, and failure handling

**Persistence**: Workflow state persisted to enable pause/resume

**Audit Trail**: All phase transitions, approvals, and artifacts logged

#### Visualization Renderer (Component 190)

A component generating human-readable representations:

**Graphviz Generation**: Converts grounding graph to DOT format with clustering, edge labels, and color coding by grounding type

**Markdown Export**: Transforms canonical domain models to structured markdown with cross-references, tables for concepts, and examples

**Interactive UI**: Web application (React-based) displaying models as navigable pages with hyperlinked concepts, embedded examples, and validation status indicators

        cardinality: "1..1"
        description: "Each context has its own ubiquitous language"
    examples:
      - "OrderManagement context responsible for order lifecycle"
      - "Inventory context responsible for stock tracking"
```

**patterns** (Set<Pattern>, optional):

Patterns are reusable structural templates:

```
Pattern := {
  pattern_id: String
  name: String
  intent: String
  structure: String
  participants: Set<ConceptReference>
  consequences: String
  examples: Set<String>
  applicability: BooleanExpression
}
```

**Example Pattern** (Repository):

```yaml
patterns:
  - pattern_id: Repository
    name: Repository Pattern
    intent: "Mediate between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects"
    structure: "Interface defining collection-like operations (add, remove, find) for aggregate access"
    participants:
      - model_id: model_ddd
        concept_id: Aggregate
      - model_id: model_ddd
        concept_id: Entity
    consequences: "Provides clean separation between domain and persistence. Enables testing with in-memory implementations. Aggregate boundaries enforced through repository."
    examples:
      - "OrderRepository provides findById, findByCustomer, save methods"
    applicability: "aggregate.persistence_strategy == 'repository'"
```

**constraints** (Set<Constraint>, optional but recommended):

Constraints define validation rules:

```
Constraint := {
  constraint_id: String
  description: String
  rule: BooleanExpression
  severity: Enum{error, warning, info}
  validator: ValidatorFunction
  message: String
}

ValidatorFunction := Artifact → Boolean
```

**Example Constraints**:

```yaml
constraints:
  - constraint_id: AGGREGATE_HAS_ROOT
    description: "Every aggregate must have exactly one root entity"
    rule: "count(aggregate.entities where is_root == true) == 1"
    severity: error
    message: "Aggregate {aggregate.id} has {count} root entities, expected exactly 1"

  - constraint_id: AGGREGATE_IDENTITY_REFERENCES
    description: "Aggregates should reference other aggregates by identity, not direct object reference"
    rule: "forall(relationship in aggregate.relationships where relationship.target.is_aggregate: relationship.type == 'identity_reference')"
    severity: warning
    message: "Aggregate {aggregate.id} directly references aggregate {target.id}; consider identity reference"
```

**grounding** (Set<GroundingReference>):

References to grounding relationships (detailed below):

```
GroundingReference := {
  grounding_id: String
}
```

The full grounding relationships are stored in the separate grounding map (Component 120) to avoid circular dependencies in model loading.

**version** (SemanticVersion, required):

```
SemanticVersion := {
  major: Integer
  minor: Integer
  patch: Integer
}
```

Versioning follows semantic versioning 2.0 specification:
- **Major**: Breaking changes (concepts removed, constraint tightened)
- **Minor**: Backward-compatible additions (new concepts, new patterns)
- **Patch**: Bug fixes (typos, clarifications)

**metadata** (Metadata):

```
Metadata := {
  schema_date: Date
  authors: Set<String>
  schema_purpose: String
  evolution_history: Set<ChangeRecord>
  tags: Set<String>
}

ChangeRecord := {
  version: SemanticVersion
  date: Date
  description: String
  breaking_changes: Boolean
  migration_guide: String
}
```

#### Storage Format

Canonical domain models are stored as YAML or JSON files conforming to JSON Schema 2020-12 meta-schema:

**File Naming Convention**: `{canonical_model_id}.yaml` or `{canonical_model_id}.json`

**Meta-Schema Location**: Stored in repository as `meta-schema.json`

**Validation**: Every model validated against meta-schema on commit using jsonschema library (Python) or equivalent

### Grounding Relationship Data Structure

Referring to Figure 8, grounding relationships are represented as a data structure comprising six primary components (6-tuple):

#### Formal Definition

```
GroundingRelationship := {
  grounding_id: String
  source: CanonicalModelID
  target: CanonicalModelID | Set<CanonicalModelID>
  type: GroundingType
  concept_mappings: Set<ConceptMapping>
  strength: GroundingStrength
  validation_rules: Set<ValidationRule>
  metadata: GroundingMetadata
}
```

#### Component Specifications

**grounding_id** (String, required, unique):
- Format: `grounding_{source}_{target}_{sequence}` (e.g., "grounding_ux_ddd_001")
- Purpose: Unique identifier for referencing this grounding

**source** (CanonicalModelID, required):
- The canonical domain model that has dependencies (e.g., "model_ux")

**target** (CanonicalModelID or Set<CanonicalModelID>, required):
- The canonical domain model(s) being depended upon (e.g., "model_ddd")
- Can be single target or set for multi-target groundings

**type** (GroundingType, required):

```
GroundingType := Enum {
  structural,
  semantic,
  procedural,
  epistemic
}
```

**Grounding Type Definitions**:

1. **structural**: Target provides foundational concepts that source builds upon
   - Characteristics: Source concepts are defined in terms of target concepts; strong dependency
   - Example: UX.Page structurally grounds in DDD.BoundedContext (page is scoped to a context)
   - Validation: Every source concept using target concepts must declare structural grounding

2. **semantic**: Target provides meaning or interpretation for source concepts
   - Characteristics: Source and target describe the same or related entities with different perspectives
   - Example: Data-Eng.Dataset semantically aligns with DDD.Aggregate (dataset schema mirrors aggregate attributes)
   - Validation: Semantic alignment score ≥70% (measured by attribute overlap)

3. **procedural**: Target defines processes, workflows, or sequences that source follows or validates
   - Characteristics: Source implements, validates, or depends on target-defined procedures
   - Example: QE.TestCase procedurally grounds in DDD.Invariant (test validates invariant)
   - Validation: Source procedures cover all mandatory target procedures

4. **epistemic**: Target provides assumptions, justifications, or foundational knowledge for source
   - Characteristics: Source's rationale or scope derives from target
   - Example: Agile.Epic epistemically grounds in DDD.BoundedContext (epic scope justified by context)
   - Validation: Source epistemic references are documented and valid

**concept_mappings** (Set<ConceptMapping>, required, non-empty):

```
ConceptMapping := {
  mapping_id: String
  source_concept: ConceptReference
  target_concept: ConceptReference
  mapping_type: MappingType
  cardinality: String
  bidirectional: Boolean
  description: String
}

MappingType := Enum {
  implements,
  validates,
  references,
  aligns,
  derives_from
}
```

**Example Concept Mappings** (UX → DDD):

```yaml
concept_mappings:
  - mapping_id: ux_page_ddd_context
    source_concept:
      model_id: model_ux
      concept_id: Page
    target_concept:
      model_id: model_ddd
      concept_id: BoundedContext
    mapping_type: references
    cardinality: "1..1"
    bidirectional: false
    description: "Every UX Page must reference exactly one DDD BoundedContext defining its domain scope"

  - mapping_id: ux_workflow_ddd_service
    source_concept:
      model_id: model_ux
      concept_id: Workflow
    target_concept:
      model_id: model_ddd
      concept_id: DomainService
    mapping_type: implements
    cardinality: "1..*"
    bidirectional: false
    description: "UX Workflow implements one or more DDD DomainService operations"
```

**strength** (GroundingStrength, required):

```
GroundingStrength := Enum {
  strong,
  weak,
  optional
}
```

- **strong**: Hard constraint; violation is an error; must be satisfied
- **weak**: Soft guidance; violation is a warning; should be satisfied
- **optional**: Informational only; violation is info-level message; may be satisfied

**validation_rules** (Set<ValidationRule>, optional):

```
ValidationRule := {
  rule_id: String
  description: String
  validator: (SourceArtifact, TargetArtifact) → ValidationResult
  error_message: String
}

ValidationResult := {
  passed: Boolean
  message: String
  violations: Set<Violation>
}

Violation := {
  location: String
  expected: String
  actual: String
  severity: Enum{error, warning, info}
}
```

**Example Validation Rule**:

```yaml
validation_rules:
  - rule_id: VR_UX_001
    description: "Verify every UX Page references a valid DDD BoundedContext"
    validator: |
      function validate(ux_artifact, ddd_model):
        for each page in ux_artifact.pages:
          context_ref = page.bounded_context_ref
          if context_ref not in ddd_model.bounded_contexts:
            return ValidationResult(
              passed=false,
              message=f"Page {page.id} references invalid context {context_ref}",
              violations=[Violation(
                location=f"page.{page.id}.bounded_context_ref",
                expected="Valid BoundedContext ID",
                actual=context_ref,
                severity=error
              )]
            )
        return ValidationResult(passed=true)
    error_message: "Invalid BoundedContext reference in UX Page"
```

**metadata** (GroundingMetadata):

```
GroundingMetadata := {
  created_date: Date
  authors: Set<String>
  rationale: String
  related_patterns: Set<PatternReference>
  examples: Set<String>
}
```

#### Storage Format

All grounding relationships are stored in a single grounding map file:

**File Location**: `research-output/interdomain-map.yaml`

**Structure**:

```yaml
version: "2.0.0"
metadata:
  total_canonical_models: 5
  total_groundings: 19
  terminology_version: "2.0.0"

canonical_models:
  - model_id: model_ddd
    layer: foundation
  - model_id: model_data_eng
    layer: foundation
  - model_id: model_ux
    layer: derived
  - model_id: model_qe
    layer: derived
  - model_id: model_agile
    layer: meta

groundings:
  - grounding_id: grounding_ux_ddd_001
    source: model_ux
    target: model_ddd
    type: structural
    strength: strong
    concept_mappings:
      - mapping_id: ux_page_ddd_context
        source_concept: "model_ux.Page"
        target_concept: "model_ddd.BoundedContext"
        cardinality: "1..1"
        mapping_type: references
    # ... additional mappings

  # ... additional 18 groundings
```

#### Grounding Graph Properties

The grounding map forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the following properties:

**Property 1 - Acyclicity**:
No path exists such that: model_A → model_B → ... → model_N → model_A

Verified using Tarjan's algorithm during validation.

**Property 2 - Layering**:
- All groundings from foundation models: none (no outgoing edges)
- All groundings from derived models: target foundation models
- All groundings from meta models: target foundation or derived models
- No grounding may target a model in the same or higher layer

**Property 3 - Transitivity** (for strong groundings):
If model_A strongly grounds in model_B, and model_B strongly grounds in model_C, then model_A implicitly grounds in model_C through transitivity.

**Property 4 - Uniqueness**:
At most one grounding relationship exists between any ordered pair (source, target). Multiple concept mappings are included within a single grounding.

### Closure Calculation Method

Referring to Figure 3, the closure property validation method determines the completeness of a canonical domain model by calculating the percentage of concept references that are resolved either internally or through explicit grounding relationships.

#### Algorithm Specification

```
FUNCTION calculate_closure(model: CanonicalDomainModel, grounding_map: GroundingMap)
  RETURNS (closure_percentage: Float, ungrounded_refs: Set<ConceptReference>)

INPUT:
  model: The canonical domain model to validate
  grounding_map: The complete grounding relationship graph

OUTPUT:
  closure_percentage: Float in range [0.0, 100.0]
  ungrounded_refs: Set of concept references that are not grounded

ALGORITHM:

  // Step 1: Collect all concept references
  all_references := Set<ConceptReference>()

  FOR EACH concept IN model.concepts:
    FOR EACH relationship IN concept.relationships:
      target := relationship.target_concept
      all_references.ADD(target)

    FOR EACH property IN concept.properties:
      IF property.type IS reference_type:
        FOR EACH ref IN property.referenced_concepts:
          all_references.ADD(ref)

  // Step 2: Classify references as internal or external
  internal_refs := Set<ConceptReference>()
  external_refs := Set<ConceptReference>()

  FOR EACH ref IN all_references:
    IF ref.model_id == model.canonical_model_id:
      internal_refs.ADD(ref)
    ELSE:
      external_refs.ADD(ref)

  // Step 3: Check external references for grounding
  grounded_external := Set<ConceptReference>()
  ungrounded_external := Set<ConceptReference>()

  FOR EACH ext_ref IN external_refs:
    ref_model_id := ext_ref.model_id
    ref_concept_id := ext_ref.concept_id

    grounding_found := FALSE

    // Find grounding to target model
    FOR EACH grounding IN grounding_map.groundings:
      IF grounding.source == model.canonical_model_id AND
         (grounding.target == ref_model_id OR ref_model_id IN grounding.target):

        // Verify specific concept is in mapping
        FOR EACH mapping IN grounding.concept_mappings:
          target_concept := mapping.target_concept

          IF target_concept.model_id == ref_model_id AND
             target_concept.concept_id == ref_concept_id:
            grounding_found := TRUE
            grounded_external.ADD(ext_ref)
            BREAK

        IF grounding_found:
          BREAK

    IF NOT grounding_found:
      ungrounded_external.ADD(ext_ref)

  // Step 4: Calculate closure percentage
  total_refs := internal_refs.COUNT() + external_refs.COUNT()
  resolved_refs := internal_refs.COUNT() + grounded_external.COUNT()

  IF total_refs == 0:
    closure_percentage := 100.0  // No references means vacuously closed
  ELSE:
    closure_percentage := (resolved_refs / total_refs) * 100.0

  // Step 5: Return results
  RETURN (closure_percentage, ungrounded_external)

END FUNCTION
```

#### Validation Thresholds

After calculating closure percentage, the system applies quality thresholds:

```
FUNCTION validate_closure_thresholds(closure_percentage: Float)
  RETURNS validation_status: ValidationStatus

  IF closure_percentage < 80.0:
    RETURN ValidationStatus(
      level: ERROR,
      message: "CRITICAL: Model closure {closure_percentage:.1f}% is below minimum threshold of 80%. Model not suitable for production use. Add missing grounding relationships."
    )

  ELSE IF closure_percentage < 95.0:
    RETURN ValidationStatus(
      level: WARNING,
      message: "WARNING: Model closure {closure_percentage:.1f}% is below target threshold of 95%. Model may be used but additional grounding recommended for production readiness."
    )

  ELSE:
    RETURN ValidationStatus(
      level: SUCCESS,
      message: "SUCCESS: Model achieves production-ready closure of {closure_percentage:.1f}%."
    )

END FUNCTION
```

#### System-Wide Closure Calculation

For systems with multiple canonical domain models:

```
FUNCTION calculate_system_closure(models: Set<CanonicalDomainModel>, grounding_map: GroundingMap)
  RETURNS system_closure_percentage: Float

  total_resolved := 0
  total_refs := 0

  FOR EACH model IN models:
    (closure_pct, ungrounded) := calculate_closure(model, grounding_map)

    model_internal := count_internal_refs(model)
    model_external := count_external_refs(model)
    model_total := model_internal + model_external
    model_resolved := (closure_pct / 100.0) * model_total

    total_resolved += model_resolved
    total_refs += model_total

  system_closure_percentage := (total_resolved / total_refs) * 100.0

  RETURN system_closure_percentage

END FUNCTION
```

#### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**:
- Let n = number of concepts in model
- Let m = average references per concept
- Let r = number of external references
- Let g = number of groundings in grounding map
- Let p = average concept mappings per grounding

**Step 1** (Collect references): O(n * m)
**Step 2** (Classify): O(n * m)
**Step 3** (Check grounding): O(r * g * p)
**Step 4** (Calculate percentage): O(1)

**Total**: O(n * m + r * g * p)

For typical systems (n=10-30, m=5-10, r=5-20, g=15-25, p=2-5), this executes in <100ms.

**Space Complexity**: O(n * m) for storing all references.

#### Implementation Example

Continuing with the system shown in Figure 2:

**DDD Model**:
- Internal concepts: 13
- External references: 0
- Grounded external: 0
- **Closure: 100%**

**UX Model**:
- Internal concepts: 11
- External references: 1 (to model_ddd.BoundedContext)
- Grounding: `grounding_ux_ddd_001` includes mapping for BoundedContext
- Grounded external: 1
- **Closure: (11 + 1) / (11 + 1) × 100% = 100%**

**QE Model**:
- Internal concepts: 12
- External references: 6 (to DDD: Aggregate, Invariant; to UX: Workflow; to Data-Eng: Dataset; to Agile: AcceptanceCriteria, UserStory)
- Groundings: `grounding_qe_ddd_001`, `grounding_qe_ux_001`, `grounding_qe_data_eng_001`, `grounding_qe_agile_001`
- All 6 external references mapped in groundings
- Grounded external: 6
- **Closure: (12 + 6) / (12 + 6) × 100% = 100%**

**System Closure**: Average across all 5 models = 100%

### LLM-Constrained Generation Method

Referring to Figure 4, the LLM-constrained generation method coordinates four phases to produce software artifacts that conform to multiple canonical domain models with cross-domain consistency guarantees.

#### Phase 1: Schema Loading

**Purpose**: Construct unified schema context containing all canonical domain models required for the task plus transitively grounded dependencies.

**Algorithm**:

```
FUNCTION load_schema_context(task_description: String, model_repository: Repository, grounding_map: GroundingMap)
  RETURNS schema_context: SchemaContext

INPUT:
  task_description: Natural language description of generation task
  model_repository: Repository containing all canonical domain models
  grounding_map: Complete grounding relationship graph

OUTPUT:
  schema_context: Unified context for LLM with all required schemas

ALGORITHM:

  // Step 1.1: Identify required models from task
  required_model_ids := identify_models_from_task(task_description)

  // Heuristic rules for identification:
  // - Contains "aggregate", "bounded context", "domain" → add model_ddd
  // - Contains "workflow", "page", "component", "UI" → add model_ux
  // - Contains "test", "quality", "validation" → add model_qe
  // - Contains "pipeline", "dataset", "schema" → add model_data_eng
  // - Contains "epic", "feature", "story", "vision" → add model_agile
  // - User can explicitly specify: "@model_ddd @model_ux" in task

  // Step 1.2: Load primary models
  loaded_models := Map<ModelID, CanonicalDomainModel>()

  FOR EACH model_id IN required_model_ids:
    model := model_repository.load(model_id)
    loaded_models[model_id] := model

  // Step 1.3: Resolve transitive grounding dependencies
  dependency_queue := Queue(loaded_models.keys())
  processed := Set<ModelID>()

  WHILE dependency_queue IS NOT EMPTY:
    current_model_id := dependency_queue.DEQUEUE()

    IF current_model_id IN processed:
      CONTINUE

    processed.ADD(current_model_id)
    current_model := loaded_models[current_model_id]

    // Find all groundings from current model
    FOR EACH grounding IN grounding_map.groundings:
      IF grounding.source == current_model_id:
        target_model_id := grounding.target

        IF target_model_id NOT IN loaded_models:
          target_model := model_repository.load(target_model_id)
          loaded_models[target_model_id] := target_model
          dependency_queue.ENQUEUE(target_model_id)

  // Step 1.4: Build unified schema context
  schema_context := SchemaContext()
  schema_context.models := loaded_models

  // Merge vocabularies with qualified names
  unified_vocabulary := Map<QualifiedName, ConceptDefinition>()

  FOR EACH (model_id, model) IN loaded_models:
    FOR EACH concept IN model.concepts:
      qualified_name := f"{model_id}.{concept.concept_id}"
      unified_vocabulary[qualified_name] := concept

  schema_context.vocabulary := unified_vocabulary

  // Merge patterns
  unified_patterns := Set<Pattern>()

  FOR EACH (model_id, model) IN loaded_models:
    FOR EACH pattern IN model.patterns:
      pattern.qualified_id := f"{model_id}.{pattern.pattern_id}"
      unified_patterns.ADD(pattern)

  schema_context.patterns := unified_patterns

  // Merge constraints
  unified_constraints := Set<Constraint>()

  FOR EACH (model_id, model) IN loaded_models:
    FOR EACH constraint IN model.constraints:
      constraint.qualified_id := f"{model_id}.{constraint.constraint_id}"
      constraint.source_model := model_id
      unified_constraints.ADD(constraint)

  schema_context.constraints := unified_constraints

  // Build grounding subgraph
  relevant_groundings := Set<GroundingRelationship>()

  FOR EACH grounding IN grounding_map.groundings:
    IF grounding.source IN loaded_models AND grounding.target IN loaded_models:
      relevant_groundings.ADD(grounding)

  schema_context.groundings := relevant_groundings

  // Step 1.5: Validate schema context
  validation_result := validate_schema_context(schema_context)

  IF NOT validation_result.passed:
    RAISE ValidationError(validation_result.message)

  RETURN schema_context

END FUNCTION
```

**Validation of Schema Context**:

```
FUNCTION validate_schema_context(schema_context: SchemaContext)
  RETURNS validation_result: ValidationResult

  errors := []

  // Check for cycles in grounding graph
  IF has_cycles(schema_context.groundings):
    errors.ADD("Circular dependency detected in grounding relationships")

  // Check for contradictory constraints
  FOR EACH constraint1 IN schema_context.constraints:
    FOR EACH constraint2 IN schema_context.constraints:
      IF constraint1 != constraint2:
        IF are_contradictory(constraint1.rule, constraint2.rule):
          errors.ADD(f"Contradictory constraints: {constraint1.qualified_id} and {constraint2.qualified_id}")

  // Check for unresolved concept references in patterns
  FOR EACH pattern IN schema_context.patterns:
    FOR EACH participant IN pattern.participants:
      qualified_name := f"{participant.model_id}.{participant.concept_id}"
      IF qualified_name NOT IN schema_context.vocabulary:
        errors.ADD(f"Pattern {pattern.qualified_id} references undefined concept {qualified_name}")

  IF errors.COUNT() > 0:
    RETURN ValidationResult(passed=FALSE, errors=errors)
  ELSE:
    RETURN ValidationResult(passed=TRUE)

END FUNCTION
```

#### Phase 2: Constrained Generation

**Purpose**: Generate software artifact using LLM with real-time constraint validation, pruning invalid candidates.

**Algorithm**:

```
FUNCTION constrained_generate(task: String, schema_context: SchemaContext, llm_interface: LLMInterface)
  RETURNS artifact: Artifact

INPUT:
  task: Task description
  schema_context: Unified schema context from Phase 1
  llm_interface: Interface to LLM API

OUTPUT:
  artifact: Generated software artifact conforming to all schemas

PARAMETERS:
  beam_width k := 5  // Number of candidate continuations per step
  max_iterations := 100  // Maximum generation steps
  temperature := 0.3  // Lower temperature for more deterministic generation

ALGORITHM:

  // Step 2.1: Construct prompt
  prompt := construct_prompt(task, schema_context)

  // Prompt structure:
  // 1. Task description
  // 2. Schema overview (1000-2000 tokens)
  // 3. Relevant concepts (5000-10000 tokens)
  // 4. Applicable patterns (2000-5000 tokens)
  // 5. Constraints (2000-5000 tokens)
  // 6. Examples from schemas (5000-10000 tokens)
  // 7. Validation checklist
  // Total: 20,000-50,000 tokens typical

#### Example Ripple Effect Scenario

**Scenario**: Add new concept "SubscriptionPolicy" to DDD model

**Step 1**: Changed model = model_ddd

**Step 2**: Identify affected models
- UX model has grounding_ux_ddd_001 (structural) → UX potentially affected
- QE model has grounding_qe_ddd_001 (procedural) → QE potentially affected
- Agile model has grounding_agile_ddd_001 (epistemic) → Agile potentially affected

**Step 3**: Check if specific concept is referenced
- UX: No existing UX workflows reference "SubscriptionPolicy" → Not affected
- QE: No existing tests reference "SubscriptionPolicy" → Not affected
- Agile: Feature "Billing" references DDD concepts generally → Validate if new concept relevant

**Step 4**: Validation
- Agile.Feature("Billing") description mentions "subscription" → Should reference new SubscriptionPolicy concept
- Validation fails: Missing reference to new concept

**Step 5**: User approval granted

**Step 6**: Regenerate
- LLM prompt: "Update Agile Feature 'Billing' to reference new DDD concept SubscriptionPolicy for subscription management"
- LLM generates updated feature description including reference to model_ddd.SubscriptionPolicy
- Validation passes

**Step 7**: Version bumps
- model_ddd: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 (minor, added concept)
- model_agile: 2.0.0 → 2.1.0 (minor, updated feature description)

**Step 8**: System closure: Still 100% (new reference grounded through existing grounding_agile_ddd_001)

**Step 9**: Commit to repository

**Step 10**: Audit trail recorded

### Greenfield Development Workflow System

Referring to Figure 6, the greenfield development workflow system orchestrates nine phases of systematic development from product vision through implementation with formal validation at each step. This workflow represents a novel end-to-end process for LLM-assisted software development with multi-domain coordination.

#### Phase 1: Vision Definition and Validation

**Input**: Initial product concept from stakeholders (unstructured text)

**Canonical Models Used**: Agile canonical model

**Process**:

1. **Vision Document Creation**:
   - Stakeholders draft product vision document describing problem, target users, solution approach, and expected outcomes
   - Document may be incomplete or inconsistent initially

2. **LLM-Assisted Completeness Check**:
   - System loads Agile canonical model schema
   - Agile.Vision concept defines required elements:
     * `problem_statement` (String, 1..1, required)
     * `target_users` (Set<Persona>, 1..*, required)
     * `value_proposition` (String, 1..1, required)
     * `success_metrics` (Set<Metric>, 1..*, required)
     * `constraints` (Set<Constraint>, 0..*, optional)
     * `assumptions` (Set<Assumption>, 0..*, optional)
     * `high_level_scope` (String, 1..1, required)
   - System constructs prompt: "Given the Agile canonical model Vision concept definition, analyze this vision document for completeness. Identify missing required elements and suggest additions."
   - LLM generates completeness report with specific gaps identified

3. **Validation Report Example**:
```yaml
completeness_check:
  status: INCOMPLETE
  missing_required:
    - success_metrics: "No quantitative success metrics defined"
  missing_optional:
    - constraints: "Budget and timeline constraints not specified"
  suggestions:
    - "Add metrics: Monthly Recurring Revenue target, Customer Churn rate target, User Satisfaction score"
    - "Specify budget constraint: e.g., Development budget $500K"
    - "Specify timeline: e.g., MVP in 6 months"
```

4. **Human Review and Iteration**:
   - Product owner reviews LLM suggestions
   - Updates vision document
   - Re-validates until completeness check passes

5. **Output Artifact**:
```yaml
# vision.yaml
vision:
  vision_id: ECOM_PLATFORM_V1
  problem_statement: "Small/medium businesses lack affordable e-commerce platforms with integrated inventory management"
  target_users:
    - persona_id: SmallBusinessOwner

    - persona_id: OnlineShopkeeper
      description: "Individual selling products online, managing inventory manually"
  value_proposition: "Unified commerce and inventory management platform under $100/month"
  success_metrics:
    - metric_id: MRR
      name: "Monthly Recurring Revenue"
      target: "$500K within 18 months"
      measurement: "Subscription revenue per month"
    - metric_id: CustomerChurn
      name: "Customer Churn Rate"
      target: "<5% monthly"
      measurement: "Percentage of customers canceling per month"
    - metric_id: UserSatisfaction
      name: "User Satisfaction Score"
      target: ">4.5/5.0"
      measurement: "Average rating from user surveys"
  constraints:
    - constraint_id: BUDGET
      type: budget
      description: "Development budget limited to $500K"
    - constraint_id: TIMELINE
      type: timeline
      description: "MVP must launch within 6 months"
  assumptions:
    - assumption_id: MIGRATION_WILLINGNESS
      description: "SMBs willing to migrate from spreadsheets to dedicated platform"
      risk: medium
    - assumption_id: PAYMENT_INTEGRATION
      description: "Stripe integration sufficient for payment processing"
      risk: low
  high_level_scope: "Core commerce (product catalog, cart, checkout), inventory tracking, order management"
  validation_status: COMPLETE

#### Phase 2: Strategic Domain Model Definition

**Input**: Validated vision.yaml, optional current state documentation

**Canonical Models Used**: DDD canonical model

**Process**:

1. **Bounded Context Identification**:
   - System loads DDD canonical model
   - Constructs prompt: "Based on this product vision and DDD canonical model (specifically BoundedContext pattern), identify bounded contexts for this system. For each context, define: responsibility, core concepts, and ubiquitous language."
   - LLM analyzes vision and proposes bounded contexts

2. **LLM Output Example**:
```yaml
proposed_bounded_contexts:
  - context_id: CATALOG
    name: "Product Catalog"
    responsibility: "Manage product information, categories, attributes, pricing, and search"
    rationale: "Product data has its own lifecycle and consistency requirements distinct from inventory and orders"
    core_concepts:
      - Product
      - Category
      - ProductAttribute
      - PriceList
      - SearchIndex
    ubiquitous_language:
      product: "Sellable item with SKU, description, and attributes"
      category: "Hierarchical grouping of products for navigation"
      price_list: "Set of prices for products, may vary by customer segment or time period"

  - context_id: INVENTORY
    name: "Inventory Management"
    responsibility: "Track stock levels, manage replenishment, record stock movements"
    rationale: "Inventory has different consistency requirements (near real-time) and different stakeholders than product information"
    core_concepts:
      - StockItem
      - Warehouse
      - StockMovement
      - ReorderPolicy
    ubiquitous_language:
      stock_item: "Physical quantity of a product at a specific warehouse"
      stock_movement: "Record of inventory change (received, sold, transferred, adjusted)"

  - context_id: ORDER
    name: "Order Management"
    responsibility: "Process customer orders, manage order lifecycle, coordinate fulfillment"
    rationale: "Orders are central business transactions requiring strong consistency and audit trail"
    core_concepts:
      - Order
      - OrderLine
      - Customer
      - OrderStatus
      - Payment
    ubiquitous_language:
      order: "Customer purchase request with line items and fulfillment status"
      order_line: "Individual product and quantity within an order"
```

3. **Domain Expert Review**:
   - Domain experts evaluate proposed contexts
   - Check for: Single responsibility, clear boundaries, appropriate granularity
   - Feedback example: "Split ORDER into ORDER and FULFILLMENT contexts - different responsibilities and teams"

4. **Context Map Generation**:
   - LLM generates relationships between contexts using DDD context map patterns
   - Patterns: Shared Kernel, Customer-Supplier, Conformist, Anti-Corruption Layer

5. **Ubiquitous Language Validation**:
   - LLM checks for term conflicts across contexts
   - Example: "Product" in CATALOG vs. "StockItem" in INVENTORY - different perspectives of same thing
   - Documents translation: CATALOG.Product ↔ INVENTORY.StockItem (via ProductSKU)

6. **Validation**:
   - DDD closure check: All concept references resolve within context or explicit cross-context references
   - Grounding check: Vision.Epic → DDD.BoundedContext mappings defined
   - Acyclicity: No circular dependencies between contexts

7. **Output Artifact**:
```yaml
# strategic-ddd-model.yaml
canonical_model_id: project_ddd_model_v1
based_on: model_ddd  # Grounded in DDD canonical model
version: 1.0.0

bounded_contexts:
  - context_id: CATALOG
    name: "Product Catalog"
    responsibility: "Manage product information, categories, search"
    aggregates:
      - aggregate_id: Product
        root_entity: Product
        entities:
          - ProductAttribute
        value_objects:
          - SKU
          - Price
        invariants:
          - "Product must have unique SKU"
          - "Price must be positive"
      - aggregate_id: Category
        root_entity: Category
        value_objects:
          - CategoryPath
        invariants:
          - "Category path must not have cycles"

  - context_id: INVENTORY
    # ... (similar detail)

  - context_id: ORDER
    # ... (similar detail)

context_map:
  relationships:
    - source: ORDER
      target: CATALOG
      relationship_type: Customer-Supplier
      integration: "ORDER consumes product information from CATALOG via Product SKU lookup"

    - source: ORDER
      target: INVENTORY
      relationship_type: Customer-Supplier
      integration: "ORDER requests stock allocation from INVENTORY, INVENTORY confirms availability"

    - source: FULFILLMENT
      target: INVENTORY
      relationship_type: Customer-Supplier
      integration: "FULFILLMENT triggers stock movement when items shipped"

validation:
  closure: 100%
  acyclicity: PASSED
  grounding_to_vision: COMPLETE
```

#### Phase 3: Vision Decomposition to Epics and Features

**Input**: vision.yaml, strategic-ddd-model.yaml

**Canonical Models Used**: Agile canonical model, DDD canonical model (via grounding)

**Process**:

1. **Epic Extraction**:
   - Prompt: "Decompose this vision into epics. Each epic must reference at least one bounded context from the strategic DDD model. Use Agile canonical model Epic structure."
   - LLM generates epics aligned with bounded contexts

2. **Grounding Validation**:
   - For each epic, verify grounding: Agile.Epic → DDD.BoundedContext
   - Check grounding relationship `grounding_agile_ddd` exists and includes Epic → BoundedContext mapping
   - Validation rule: `epic.bounded_context_refs` must contain valid context IDs from strategic-ddd-model.yaml

3. **Feature Definition**:
   - For each epic, LLM generates features
   - Each feature includes: ID, name, description, user value, acceptance criteria, dependencies
   - Grounding: Agile.Feature → DDD.Aggregate (weak), Agile.Feature → UX.Workflow (strong, deferred to Phase 4)

4. **Cross-Model Validation**:
   - Verify all epic → bounded context references valid
   - Verify no orphaned features (every feature belongs to epic)
   - Validate feature dependencies align with context map relationships

5. **Product Owner Review**:
   - Evaluate epic/feature decomposition for completeness
   - Adjust priorities
   - Approve or request regeneration

6. **Output Artifact**:
```yaml
# roadmap.yaml
canonical_model_id: project_roadmap_v1
based_on: model_agile
version: 1.0.0

epics:
  - epic_id: CATALOG_MANAGEMENT
    name: "Product Catalog Management"
    description: "Enable business owners to create, update, and organize product catalog with categories and attributes"
    bounded_context_refs:

    dependencies:
      - CATALOG_001  # Needs products to exist

validation:
  all_epics_grounded: true
  all_features_have_epic: true
  no_circular_dependencies: true
```

#### Phase 4: User Story Decomposition

**Input**: roadmap.yaml (features prioritized for current sprint), strategic-ddd-model.yaml

**Canonical Models Used**: Agile, DDD, UX (via grounding)

**Process**:

1. **User Story Generation**:
   - For each feature in sprint backlog, generate user stories
   - Prompt includes: Agile.UserStory schema, DDD bounded context details, Feature description
   - Format: "As [Persona], I want [Goal] so that [Benefit]"

2. **Acceptance Criteria Definition**:
   - LLM generates testable acceptance criteria for each story
   - Grounding: Agile.AcceptanceCriteria → DDD.Invariant (must validate business rules)
   - Ensures each criterion is testable and aligned with domain invariants

3. **Workflow Mapping**:
   - LLM proposes UX workflow outline for each story
   - Deferred detailed design to Phase 6, but establishes references

4. **Technical Task Breakdown**:
   - LLM generates tasks: Domain model implementation, persistence, API, UI, testing
   - Grounding: Tasks reference DDD aggregates, future UX components, QE test cases

5. **Example Output**:
```yaml

#### Phase 5: Quality Engineering Model Refinement

**Input**: sprint-backlog.yaml (with acceptance criteria), strategic-ddd-model.yaml

**Canonical Models Used**: QE, DDD, Agile, UX (groundings)

**Process**:

1. **Test Strategy Definition**:
   - LLM generates comprehensive test strategy
   - Defines test levels: unit, integration, E2E, performance, security
   - Coverage targets: >80% for unit, >60% for integration
   - Risk-based prioritization

2. **Invariant-Driven Unit Test Generation**:
   - Extract all invariants from strategic-ddd-model.yaml
   - For each invariant, generate unit test case
   - Grounding: QE.TestCase → DDD.Invariant (procedural, strong)

3. **Acceptance Criteria Test Generation**:
   - For each Agile.AcceptanceCriteria, generate QE.TestCase
   - Grounding: QE.TestCase → Agile.AcceptanceCriteria (epistemic, strong)

4. **Example Test Cases**:

#### Phase 6: User Experience Model Refinement

**Input**: sprint-backlog.yaml, strategic-ddd-model.yaml

**Canonical Models Used**: UX, DDD (via grounding)

**Process**:

1. **Information Architecture**:
   - LLM generates site map with pages
   - Each page must reference bounded context (grounding validation)
   - Navigation hierarchy generated

2. **Page Design**:
   - For each page, LLM defines: Components, data bindings, actions
   - Grounding: UX.Page → DDD.BoundedContext (structural, strong)
   - Grounding: UX.DataBinding → DDD.Repository (structural)

3. **Workflow Detailed Design**:
   - Expand workflow outlines from Phase 4
   - Define: Steps, validations, state transitions, error handling
   - Grounding: UX.Workflow → DDD.DomainService (procedural, strong)

4. **Example Output**:
```yaml

#### Phase 7: Data Engineering Model Definition

**Input**: strategic-ddd-model.yaml (aggregates with attributes), ux-model.yaml

**Canonical Models Used**: Data-Eng, DDD (via semantic grounding)

**Process**:

1. **Dataset Identification**:
   - Analyze DDD aggregates for persistence needs
   - Generate dataset for each aggregate or aggregate group
   - Grounding: Data-Eng.Dataset semantically aligns with DDD.Aggregate (≥70% attribute overlap)

2. **Schema Generation**:
   - Map aggregate attributes to dataset schema fields
   - Calculate semantic alignment percentage
   - Warn if alignment <70%

3. **Example**:
```yaml
# data-eng-model.yaml
canonical_model_id: project_data_eng_model_v1
based_on: model_data_eng
version: 1.0.0

datasets:
  - dataset_id: products_table

#### Phase 8: Bounded Code Generation

**Input**: All models from Phases 2-7, prioritized user stories

**Canonical Models Used**: All (DDD, UX, QE, Data-Eng, Agile)

**Process**:

1. **Code Generation with Full Schema Context**:
   - Developer selects task: "Implement Product aggregate"
   - System loads ALL relevant models:
     * strategic-ddd-model.yaml (Product aggregate spec)
     * ux-model.yaml (ProductForm, workflows using Product)
     * qe-model.yaml (Product invariant tests)
     * data-eng-model.yaml (products_table schema)
   - Schema context size: ~30,000-50,000 tokens

2. **Constrained Generation Example**:

**Prompt to LLM**:
```
Task: Implement the Product aggregate from the CATALOG bounded context.

Context:
- DDD Canonical Model: Aggregate pattern requires root entity, identity-based references, invariant enforcement
- Strategic DDD Model: Product aggregate specification (see below)
- QE Model: Unit tests that must pass (see below)
- Data-Eng Model: Database schema this aggregate persists to (see below)

Product Aggregate Specification:
{strategic-ddd-model.CATALOG.Product}

Invariants that MUST be enforced:
1. REQUIRED_FIELDS: name, sku, price must be provided
2. POSITIVE_PRICE: price > 0
3. UNIQUE_SKU: sku must be unique (checked at repository level)

Test Cases that MUST pass:
{qe-model.TC_CATALOG_001, TC_CATALOG_002, TC_CATALOG_003}

Generate Python code for Product aggregate following DDD patterns.
```

**LLM Generated Code**:
```python
# catalog/domain/model/product.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from decimal import Decimal
from typing import Optional
from uuid import UUID, uuid4

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SKU:
    """Value Object: Product SKU"""
    value: str

    def __post_init__(self):
        if not self.value:
            raise ValueError("SKU cannot be empty")
        if len(self.value) > 50:
            raise ValueError("SKU cannot exceed 50 characters")

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Money:
    """Value Object: Price"""
    amount: Decimal
    currency: str = "USD"

    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Price must be positive")  # Enforces POSITIVE_PRICE invariant

class Product:
    """
    Aggregate Root: Product

    Bounded Context: CATALOG
    Responsibility: Manage product information for catalog

    Invariants:
    - REQUIRED_FIELDS: name, sku, price must be provided
    - POSITIVE_PRICE: price > 0 (enforced by Money value object)
    - UNIQUE_SKU: sku must be unique (enforced by repository)
    """

    def __init__(
        self,
        product_id: UUID,
        sku: SKU,
        name: str,
        price: Money,
        description: Optional[str] = None
    ):
        # Enforce REQUIRED_FIELDS invariant
        if not name:
            raise ValueError("Product name is required")
        if not sku:
            raise ValueError("Product SKU is required")
        if not price:
            raise ValueError("Product price is required")

        self._product_id = product_id
        self._sku = sku
        self._name = name
        self._price = price
        self._description = description

    @staticmethod
    def create(sku: str, name: str, price: Decimal, description: Optional[str] = None) -> 'Product':
        """Factory method for creating new Product"""
        return Product(
            product_id=uuid4(),
            sku=SKU(sku),
            name=name,
            price=Money(price),
            description=description
        )

    @property
    def product_id(self) -> UUID:
        return self._product_id

    @property
    def sku(self) -> SKU:
        return self._sku

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._name

    @property
    def price(self) -> Money:
        return self._price

    def update_price(self, new_price: Decimal) -> None:
        """Update product price (enforces POSITIVE_PRICE)"""
        self._price = Money(new_price)  # Money validates positive

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Product):
            return False
        return self._product_id == other._product_id

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self._product_id)
```

3. **Validation**:
   - Run generated unit tests from QE model
   - Verify invariants enforced
   - Check code follows DDD patterns (aggregate root, value objects, etc.)

4. **Result**: Code that is:
   - Consistent with domain model specification
   - Validates all invariants
   - Passes all tests
   - Follows canonical patterns

#### Phase 9: Continuous Evolution with Impact Analysis

**Scenario**: Add "quantity discount" feature requiring new aggregate concepts

**Process**:

1. **Change Request**: "Add volume pricing: customers get discounts when buying quantities >10"

2. **Impact Analysis** (using Ripple Effect Management from earlier):
   - Changed model: DDD (add QuantityDiscount concept to Product aggregate)
   - Affected models:
     * UX: ProductForm needs discount fields
     * QE: New tests for discount calculation
     * Data-Eng: products_table needs discount columns
     * Agile: Update feature description

3. **Coordinated Regeneration**:
   - All affected artifacts regenerated with new constraint
   - Validation ensures consistency
   - Version bumps: All models go from x.y.z → x.(y+1).0

4. **Outcome**: System-wide consistency maintained through formal process

This completes the detailed nine-phase workflow specification demonstrating the invention's systematic approach to multi-domain LLM-assisted development with formal validation at every step.

## ABSTRACT

A computer-implemented system and method for multi-domain knowledge coordination in large language model-assisted software development uses canonical domain models with explicit grounding relationships. Each canonical domain model comprises concepts, patterns, constraints, and typed grounding relationships (structural, semantic, procedural, epistemic) to other models. The system calculates a closure property indicating reference resolution completeness and validates acyclicity. During software artifact generation, the system loads relevant canonical domain models with transitive dependencies, constructs a unified schema context, and constrains LLM generation through validation. Generated artifacts are validated for cross-domain consistency via grounding relationships. The system automates ripple effect management by traversing the grounding graph to identify and update affected models when changes occur. Empirical results show 25-50% accuracy improvement, 4-7x faster solution synthesis, and 3x fewer integration defects with >95% closure. Applications include systematic greenfield development from product vision through strategic domain modeling, epic decomposition, user story generation, quality engineering refinement, user experience design, data engineering modeling, to bounded code generation with continuous evolution.
