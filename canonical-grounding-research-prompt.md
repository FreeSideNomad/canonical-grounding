**Title:** Examining Canonical Grounding as a Framework for Layered Ontological Reasoning in LLM Systems

**Goal:**
To evaluate the conceptual validity, empirical grounding, and research lineage of *Canonical Grounding* as a meta-methodology for structuring interdependent domains (DDD, Data Engineering, UX, QE, Agile) in LLM-assisted reasoning systems.

## üß≠ Phase 1 ‚Äî Conceptual Foundation (1‚Äì10)
1. Define ‚ÄúCanonical Grounding‚Äù formally: ontology, canon, grounding relationships.  
2. Compare its semantics to ‚Äúdogma,‚Äù ‚Äúcanon,‚Äù ‚Äúaxiom,‚Äù and ‚Äúontology‚Äù in philosophical and AI contexts.  
3. Map philosophical roots (Aristotle ‚Üí Kant ‚Üí Quine ‚Üí grounding in metaphysics).  
4. Identify modern analogues: *ontological commitment* (Gruber 1993), *epistemic grounding* (Bender & Koller 2020).  
5. Review uses of ‚Äúcanon‚Äù in knowledge representation, theology, literary theory, and software engineering.  
6. Distinguish between *internal consistency* (canon) and *inter-domain dependency* (grounding).  
7. Define properties: completeness, closure, coherence, composability.  
8. Propose typology of grounding: structural, semantic, procedural, epistemic.  
9. Clarify relationship to *knowledge levels* (Fowler, Sowa).  
10. Establish working definitions and ontology graph of five target domains.

## üß© Phase 2 ‚Äî Comparative Theoretical Analysis (11‚Äì20)
11. Compare Canonical Grounding with *Domain-Driven Design‚Äôs Bounded Contexts*.  
12. Analyze *Data Engineering* as a grounding layer: schema, data lineage, semantic contracts.  
13. Examine *UX* as derived canon: grounded in DDD + Data semantics.  
14. Evaluate *Quality Engineering* canon: validation of prior domain assumptions.  
15. Study *Agile methodology* as meta-canon managing temporal evolution of others.  
16. Compare with *Kuhn‚Äôs paradigm theory* and *Lakatos‚Äôs research programmes*.  
17. Contrast with *ontological layering* in model-driven architecture (MDA).  
18. Relate to *knowledge representation levels* (Sowa, OWL, RDF).  
19. Compare to *conceptual schema approach* in information systems (Wand & Weber).  
20. Position Canonical Grounding relative to *epistemic pluralism* and *scientific realism*.

## üßÆ Phase 3 ‚Äî Empirical and Computational Validation (21‚Äì30)
21. Review LLM ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù literature (schema-based, RAG, ontology-aware models).  
22. Identify experiments where grounding reduces hallucinations or improves accuracy.  
23. Analyze results from *Schema-Grounded LLMs* (Xu et al., 2024).  
24. Compare performance of ungrounded vs. schema-grounded reasoning tasks.  
25. Design pilot test: prompt LLM to reason within each canon (DDD, UX, QE).  
26. Measure reduction in reasoning entropy / token perplexity.  
27. Evaluate cross-domain inference consistency.  
28. Quantify benefits in solution synthesis time and coherence.  
29. Examine alignment with SWE-Bench, GPQA, and reasoning benchmarks.  
30. Document qualitative reasoning patterns (traceability, hierarchical referencing).

## üß± Phase 4 ‚Äî Formalization and Modeling (31‚Äì40)
31. Develop formal meta-model for Canonical Grounding (entities: Canon, Domain, GroundingLink).  
32. Define YAML / JSON Schema syntax for declaring canons.  
33. Encode dependency rules (UX grounded in DDD + Data Engineering, etc.).  
34. Represent model in graph form (RDF/OWL or Graphviz).  
35. Create grammar (BNF) for expressing Canonical DSL.  
36. Validate canonical closure (no semantic orphan nodes).  
37. Prove compositional properties (e.g. transitive grounding consistency).  
38. Map to ArchiMate or UML metamodel for interoperability.  
39. Formalize reasoning protocol: LLM reads schema ‚Üí constrains generation.  
40. Document mapping procedure from Canon ‚Üí Prompt ‚Üí Generated Artifact.

---

## üß† Phase 5 ‚Äî Synthesis and Evaluation (41‚Äì50)
41. Compare Canonical Grounding to *Dogma*, *Paradigm*, *Framework*, *Architecture*.  
42. Assess whether Canonical Grounding meets scientific criteria (testability, coherence, usefulness).  
43. Identify epistemic risks (rigidity, over-constraint).  
44. Evaluate adaptability to new domains (e.g. Compliance, Legal, Finance).  
45. Survey practitioners on intuitiveness and learnability of Canonical DSL.  
46. Evaluate cognitive load for domain experts reasoning within canons.  
47. Test LLM fine-tuning or RAG integration on Canonical datasets.  
48. Document findings against design-science evaluation frameworks (Hevner).  
49. Synthesize research lineage: from ontology engineering ‚Üí schema grounding ‚Üí LLM reasoning.  
50. Draft final meta-framework: **Canonical Grounding for Knowledge-Layered Reasoning Systems**, including limitations and next-phase research plan.
